# TINYTANG TECHNICAL REFERENCE

> **Project:** TinyTang
> **Purpose:** The authoritative lookup for externally defined facts this project depends on: the board's wiring and fitted parts, the BL616's registers and memory, the interface contract of the FPGA cores we boot, the contracts of the external projects we embed, and the behaviour of the vendor tools.
> **Authority:** Per `.ai/core.md`, consult this file before looking anything up online, and open the record behind any hardware fact before acting on it. A record is authoritative to the extent of its `status` and cited `sources`. When a better or newer source is found online, add or revise a record and notify the user.

This file records what an outside source (a datasheet, schematic, vendor SDK, vendor tool, or external repository) says, plus hardware observations that confirm or refute it. It does not record project history, build results, or discussion; those belong in `core-log.md`. It does not record project design choices unless an external fact forces them.

Some records are negative results — facts about what this hardware *cannot* do, or an open defect's ruled-out causes. They are recorded because each cost a session to establish and each would otherwise be re-litigated: see USB-002, USB-003, NEST-002, BLE-007 and BLE-017.

## 1. AI operating rules

```yaml
schema_version: 1

record_kinds:
  - DEVICE      # FPGA silicon: part, revision, identification
  - BOARD       # Tang Console 138K board: pins, parts, clocks, wiring, power
  - SOC         # BL616 microcontroller: address map, USB block, power domains
  - USB         # USB behaviour on this board: roles, VBUS, speeds, stack lifecycle
  - FLASH       # BL616 flash layout and boot image format
  - PROTOCOL    # the BL616 <-> loaded FPGA core UART contract
  - EXTERNAL    # interface contracts owned by other projects
  - TOOLCHAIN   # Bouffalo SDK, CherryUSB, Gowin EDA, RISC-V toolchain

statuses:
  VERIFIED:   "Primary source cited AND confirmed on this project's hardware or tools."
  SOURCED:    "Primary source cited; not yet confirmed on this project's hardware or tools."
  INFERRED:   "Derived from secondary sources, reverse inspection, or consistent observation; no primary source. Flag before relying on it."

rules:
  - "One fact or one tightly coupled fact group per record."
  - "Every record cites at least one source with enough detail to re-check it: repository path plus commit, file, symbol, register name, or tool version."
  - "Separate what the source says (statement) from what it means for this project (consequence)."
  - "Diagnostic or implementation limits chosen by this project are never recorded as standard or device limits."
  - "A record holds what is true now. When a fact changes or proves wrong, edit the record in place: revise statement and consequence, update verified_date and sources, and end verification with 'Revised <date> (core-log entry N): <what changed>'. Git and core-log.md keep the history; this file does not."
  - "Before acting on a record, check that the code paths and symbols it cites still exist; fix the record in the same cycle if they do not."
  - "Never reuse a record_id. When a record is folded into another, or split, move its id to the retired-id table in section 8 with the record that now holds its facts, after checking that every fact still true has been carried across."
  - "An INFERRED record must say how it was inferred, in verification."
  - "A negative result is a fact. Record what the hardware cannot do with the same rigour as what it can, and say how many attempts established it. An open defect may be recorded as its established facts and ruled-out causes, with any lead labelled as a lead."
  - "When an online lookup was needed because this file had no answer, add the finding here with the existing syntax, then notify the user if the source is newer or more valid than a record already here."
  - "Use technical names (GW5AST-138, BL616, CDC, OTG). The user's conversational names are not used in this file."

## 4. Fast lookup index

One line per live record, in the order of section 5. Retired ids are in section 8.

```yaml
DEV-001: "The FPGA is a GW5AST-138; its JTAG IDCODE is 0x0001081b, reported as ID=0001081b on every tangload"
DEV-002: "cores/console138k/nestang.bin is 4,593,044 bytes and byte-identical to nand2mario's generated console138k artifact (GW5AST-138B)"
DEV-004: "A core bitstream can carry AE350 RISC-V software: the program is compiled to a hex file and read into a boot ROM inside the design with $readmemh, so it is synthesised into the bitstream and arrives with tangload; the firmware loads whole images and never AE350 code as an artifact of its own"
DEV-005: "The menu core is the console138k design with nestang's NES machine not instantiated: MENU_CORE in src/boards/console138k_menu.v, selected by build.tcl's third `menu` argument; it answers CORE_ID 1, the same value the patched NES core answers, and is about four fifths smaller in logic while its bitstream is only ~2.5 percent smaller"
DEV-006: "The FPGA is not empty at power-up: with no tangload it is already running a core that answers core ID 0 on the UART and shows a TangCore splash on HDMI, so it configures itself from storage of its own; boot.tdsh replaces it within seconds, and every boot reloads this project's core (tangload, fpga, nesload for a cartridge)"

BRD-007: "One-wire and two-wire cannot be combined: by the user's account the board's modules are powered from one input or the other, never both, and making the two work together was tried at length in the earlier projects without success; no written record of that work was found"

PHOS-004: "FLAC is sent as fLaC with STREAMINFO marked as the last metadata block plus the unchanged frames, so large PICTURE or PADDING blocks do not delay the first frame; gapless handover needs core capability bit 7 and the player's draining state 7, queued up to one PCM FIFO (about 0.4 s) ahead"
PHOS-005: "Cover art is a baseline JPEG centre-fitted to 92x92 RGB332 on the BL616 and uploaded to an inactive FPGA bank before one atomic commit; the audible-stream register 0xa4 gates the display change"
PHOS-006: "The merged Phosphor core's FPGA player is pcm_sink, a raw-PCM sink with no WAV or FLAC parser; it takes its rate from the AE350's last play_rate, latched at stream start, so a file streamed straight to it plays its bytes as samples at that rate, and every file must go through the resident AE350 player"
PHOS-007: "A resident AE350 player hangs at the start of its first decode depending on its image layout: a null jump, RAM-bridge ERROR responses from address 0 and no return; the streamed player needs 16 bytes where an input would go (0 and 32 hang, 16 and 48 play), which Tang-Phosphor's Makefile now reserves; the cause is not found"
PHOS-008: "The qualified resident player is 863764 bytes, CRC-32 ef1502ed, built by make -C software/rbhost bench-universal BENCH_NAME=resident with ~/.cache/tangcore-dev/toolchain/bin (Xuantie GCC 10.2.0) on PATH; the image left in Tang-Phosphor's build/rbhost/bench was the 863748-byte 3d762d13 that hangs (PHOS-007), so a player is rebuilt and its CRC checked before use"
PHOS-009: "The merged core's pcm_sink has no stop: an AE350 restart (0x43f0) ends the decode and pause (0x78 bit 0) silences it, but the sink stays in its playing state, and the stopped track's samples (up to 2048 in the sink and 512 in the AE350 stream queue) stay queued ahead of the next START, so a sink kept paused never takes that START; underruns (0x6c) clear only with the core, 0x30 counts STARTs, and elapsed and duration (0x8c, 0x90) read 0"
PHOS-010: "The whole file is streamed to the AE350 before the first sample plays, about 3.7 s per MB (4,387,971 B in 16,064 ms), so a song loads silently for many seconds; files up to 5.8 MB play, and where the AE350's memory limits file size is not known"
PHOS-011: "Since Tang-Phosphor register ABI 1.8 (0x04 reads 0x00010008) cpu_mode is its own readable word at 0xa8; before it, it was bit 0 of the socket control word 0xc0, so selecting the AE350 released both PMOD sockets; ae350_play selects the CPU at 0xa8 on every play and refuses an older core"
PHOS-012: "Unqualified resident-player contract: a length-0 mailbox request is a question chosen by its offset, 0 SIZE, 1 NEXT (queued track's size, 0 when none, 0xffffffff STOP) and 2 POLL (1 when a stop is pending), each answered as a four-byte session least significant byte first; the player publishes RES1 (0x52455331) at 0x4040, tracks begun 0x4044, tracks finished 0x4048, last track's samples 0x404c and decode status 0x4050"
PHOS-013: "Lessons from the discarded resident gapless player experiment: detect residency by loader RUN plus the RES1 marker, number a track as tracks begun plus one and treat it as over when tracks finished reaches that number, stop softly through the mailbox with a halt fallback, re-take the mailbox baseline whenever the BL616 has not itself started the resident player, and settle PHOS-007 and the RAM bridge before qualifying a player that never returns"
PROV-001: "Lineage as the user states it: nand2mario's TangCore is the origin for Tang-Phosphor and Tang-PSX; Tang-Control is a fork of the same repo for peek/poke and the 1-wire and 2-wire debug arrangements; the family also uses a DDR3 IP block, TinyDesk, and CERN's colibri as a reference; the remembered memory module turned out to be nand2mario's JTAG bit-bang programmer, and Tang-PSX is being archived rather than deleted"
PROV-003: "colibri is CERN's vendor-independent, fully verified, open-source VHDL common library at gitlab.cern.ch/colibri/colibri, with an unofficial SystemVerilog port at github.com/kavierim/colibri-sv pinned to upstream 3fa78412; read the port when working in SystemVerilog since it ships an AGENTS.md and targets Verilator and free tooling, but treat the original as the authority; licensed CERN-OHL-W-2.0 (weakly reciprocal), not MIT, with no code copied here"
PROV-005: "TinyTang is MIT with thirteen Apache-2.0 files: nand2mario's JTAG programmer, and ten Phosphor transport files and two host tests written by this project's author in Tang-Control; it descends from nand2mario's TangCore firmware-bl616 through Tang-Control, a fork of it, and copies no other TangCore source; THIRD_PARTY.md must keep saying the UART protocol was read from GPL-3.0 nestang as a specification, not copied"

PSX-003: "50 MHz oscillator on FPGA pin V22; the BL616 control UART reaches the FPGA on V14 (FPGA RX) and U15 (FPGA TX), LVCMOS33 - the other end of the link PROT-003 describes from the BL616 side; all three confirmed on this board by the AE350 system at 2 Mbaud"
PSX-004: "Module connector U1201, 8-pin JST SH: 1 5V0 via diode (~4.4 V), 2 TMS T13, 3 TDO U13, 4 TCK V12, 5 TDI R13, 6 RX V14, 7 TX U15, 8 GND; the JTAG nets are shared with the BL616, so an external adapter must be released during a tangload, pins 6 and 7 stay unconnected, and pin 1 must not reach a 3.3 V adapter"
PSX-005: "Dock SDRAM is Winbond W9825G6KH-6, 32 MB x16 at 166 MHz, on connectors J9 and J10 (on this board, J9 only: BRD-010), separate from the SOM's 1 GiB x32 DDR3; neither is the BL616's memory, which is 320 KB of on-chip OCRAM (BL6-002)"
PSX-006: "A loaded core is indicated by active_core, the low byte of its CORE_ID (0x01 nestang, 0x50 Phosphor, 0x51 Gate 1), not by core_running, which reads no while a core answers; uploads are refused while a core runs; the link is 2 Mbaud with a 5 Mbaud fast mode and needs an iosys clock at least 8x the baud"
BLE-001: "The BL616's antenna pin runs through L9 (0 ohm) to U35, a U.FL jack marked ANT on the dock's underside, with no antenna from the factory; bare, the radio connects only close up with frequent HCI 0x3E failures; since 2026-10-10 a 2.4 GHz 6 dBi antenna is fitted on an RP-SMA pigtail, and a device that read -70 dBm bare reads -33 dBm"
BLE-002: "Scanning and connecting need the SDK's ble1m10s1bredr0 controller library (central, observer, 10 links); ble1m0s1bredr0 has neither role; Bluetooth costs 236,096 B of image, 32 KB of RAM the linker reserves and 52.6 KB of boot heap, and the controller cannot be shut down once started; the stack starts on first use or at boot when pairings are saved"
BLE-003: "Against the K950, bt_gatt_discover by service UUID (0x1812) and descriptor discovery by UUID (0x2902) found nothing, while unfiltered discovery found the same attributes; discover everything in range and filter in the callback"
BLE-004: "With BFLB_BLE_PATCH_NOTIFY_WRITE_CCC_RSP on, the SDK calls a subscription's notify callback with data NULL when the CCC write enabling it succeeds, the same signal gatt.h documents as the subscription being removed; a NULL report there is not an unsubscribe"
BLE-005: "Issuing many ATT requests at once from host callbacks blocks the host on ATT TX buffer allocation for ever; issue one request at a time, each from the previous one's completion (hid_setup_next() in tang_ble.c)"
BLE-006: "Logitech K950 in Bluetooth mode is HID over GATT on BLE: a random address that changes each time it enters pairing mode, Just Works pairing, boot protocol supported (Boot Keyboard Input value handle 0x23, CCC 0x24, Protocol Mode 0x4D) and the standard 8-byte boot report"
BLE-007: "Only Bluetooth LE HID over GATT devices can be used: the SDK's Classic profiles are A2DP, AVRCP, HFP hands-free, RFCOMM and SDP, with no HID, so a Classic-only device such as the Rii K06 (Bluetooth 3.0) cannot connect"
BLE-008: "A BLE keyboard notifies only when its key state changes, with no heartbeat, so it counts as live while connected and is zeroed on disconnect; its reports bypass the core, so left-alt pointer mode is applied in firmware by tang_key_pointer()"
BLE-009: "Logitech M750 over BLE: random address that increases by one per pairing, Just Works, Boot Mouse Input at value handle 0x23 (CCC 0x24), Protocol Mode 0x35; its boot report is 4 bytes with the wheel in byte 3, and its 7-byte report-protocol report is 16-bit buttons, 12-bit X and Y packed in 3 bytes, wheel and pan"
BLE-010: "The SDK host keeps a bonded peer's GATT subscriptions on disconnect unless BT_GATT_SUBSCRIBE_FLAG_VOLATILE is set, and re-sends them on reconnect; reusing those params structs for a new subscription rewrites a node still in its list and returns -EALREADY"
BLE-011: "This SDK's config.h defines CONFIG_BT_WHITELIST, which compiles out bt_le_set_auto_conn and the host's reconnect-after-disconnect; reconnection is one whitelist initiator (bt_conn_create_auto_le) that connects the first whitelisted device to advertise and stops, cannot run beside an explicit scan or connect, and needs the whitelist unchanged while it runs"
BLE-012: "Pairings are kept on the SD card in /sd/root/ble/bonds.bin (keys unencrypted) and restored at boot; a failed first re-encryption (level 1, error 8, then HCI 0x3E) is retried by the next connection and must not drop the key; a device that forgot its key gives error 2, on which the key is dropped, or a silent 'requesting encryption' then 0x3E, which only forget clears"
BLE-014: "Starting the Bluetooth stack takes about 15.8 KB of heap and a connection about 700 B (heap_3, read with kfree_size(); no lowest-ever counter); with both devices connected about 64.7 KB stays free (largest block 40.5 KB) across cartridge loads and desktop sessions, and reconnects do not leak"

BLE-017: "Xbox Wireless Controller on this host: closed as unsupported on this board. No report has ever arrived; with this board's host traffic matching BlueZ's packet for packet it still stops answering as pairing completes, and the newer controller library in Bouffalo SDK 2.3.36 behaves identically, so the fault is the BL616's binary controller library rather than the host, the SDK version or the radio path"
BLE-018: "2.3.36's bt_conn_unref ends with BT_ASSERT(old > 0) where the fork was only atomic_dec, and bt_conn_create_le() returns a caller reference only for a newly created connection; releasing one that was not taken asserts in recv_thread and resets the board"
TOOL-001: "CONFIG_CHERRYUSB_HOST is required for the CDC to enumerate with FreeRTOS enabled; CONFIG_NEWLIB stops enumeration"
TOOL-002: "The Gowin programmer's accepted IDCODEs: GW5A-25 0x0001281b, GW5AT-60 0x0001481b, GWAST-138 0x0001081b, GW5AT-138 0x0001181b, GW2A-18 0x0000081b"
TOOL-003: "Bouffalo SDK 2.0.0 at ~/.cache/tangcore-dev/sdk with the T-Head RISC-V GCC 10.2.0 toolchain"
TOOL-004: "A Gowin bitstream names its device: nestang's console138k project is GW5AST-138B, and build.tcl generates the project from the device name rather than checking one in"
TOOL-005: "The USB-enumeration bisection is kept as proj.min.conf, proj.nonewlib.conf and proj.rtos.conf plus ref/, selected by TINYTANG_MIN, TINYTANG_RTOS, TINYTANG_NONEWLIB, TINYTANG_REF, TINYTANG_USB_ONLY, TINYTANG_NO_FS and TINYTANG_NO_SHELL"
TOOL-006: "tools/ holds tinytang_flash.py (reflash over CDC), tinytang_put.py (file onto the card), tinytang_run.py (run a shell command) and their shared guard tinytang_console.py, all needing pyserial, plus ble_trace_to_btsnoop.py for bletrace dumps; one command's console output is cut after about 4.5 KB, so long dumps are fetched in ranges"
TOOL-007: "ports/bl616/tang_jtag_programmer.c is nand2mario's Apache-2.0 Gowin GPIO JTAG programmer from Tang-Control's fpga/programmer.cpp, based on openFPGALoader, vendored unmodified apart from its include list"
TOOL-010: "A carried patch stops being recognised once a later cycle edits the lines it added: the reverse check wants those lines present verbatim and the forward check wants them absent, so scripts/apply-nestang-patches.sh presumes the series applied in a tree with local changes, and the guarantee is the fresh-clone reconstruction test rather than the applier's check"
TOOL-011: "The console's input is exclusive, so the host tools ask the board before sending: the probe ESC [ ? 7 7 n is taken out of the USB input by the firmware, unseen by the shell or the desktop, and answered ESC [ ? 7 7 ; 1 n at the shell prompt, 2 with the desktop running, and not at all while a command runs; tools/tinytang_console.py sends nothing unless the answer is 1; a raw upload into the desktop once wrecked the card's FAT (recover with fsck.vfat)"
TOOL-012: "One-wire debugging reaches the FPGA only: JTAG on FT2232 interface 0 (openFPGALoader -c ft2232; --detect reads 0x0001081b and changes nothing; an SRAM load must be .fs, not .bin) and the FPGA UART on interface 1 (/dev/ttyUSB1, 2 Mbaud, the same 0xAA frames as the BL616 link); no shell, desktop, boot script or TinyTang tool runs, and reaching it takes a cold power-up that also restarts the FPGA, so it cannot inspect a state reached under TinyDesk"
TOOL-013: "A core can be developed entirely over one-wire: SRAM-load its .fs over JTAG with Tang-Phosphor's scripts/flash-otg.sh (17 s for the merged Phosphor image), then identify, peek, poke and stream to it on /dev/ttyUSB1 at 2 Mbaud with tools/fpga_uart.py and scripts/play_stream.py; an MP3 played through the AE350 this way gave 441000 samples, 0 underruns, 44100 Hz"
TOOL-014: "A third debug path: a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 CMSIS-DAP probe (2e8a:000c) on the module's U1201 header is its own USB device on the host, set up and validated by the user; Tang-Phosphor's scripts/flash-pico.sh drives it with openFPGALoader -c cmsisdap at 2 MHz or less (a full .fs takes 10-20 min), its real use is GAO and independent JTAG checks, and it must be idle during a tangload"
TOOL-015: "With FF_FS_REENTRANT 1 the SDK's FatFS R0.15 takes a FreeRTOS mutex (xSemaphoreTake with FF_FS_TIMEOUT ticks) on entry to every file call and gives it on exit, and FreeRTOS forbids API calls inside taskENTER_CRITICAL, so no f_* call may run inside a critical section; the JTAG programmer's did and failed tangload under TinyDesk"
TOOL-016: "Linked out of the SDK under their own licences: FreeRTOS V10.4.6 (MIT, (C) 2021 Amazon.com), CherryUSB (Apache-2.0), FatFs R0.15 w/patch3 (ChaN), and the Bluetooth stack: the Zephyr-derived host (Apache-2.0; Intel, Nordic, Wind River, Oticon, Chettimada), TinyCrypt (BSD-3-Clause, Intel 2017), micro-ecc (BSD-2-Clause, Kenneth MacKay 2014) and ctr_prng (BSD-2-Clause, Chris Morrison 2016), whose binary-form notices are reproduced in LICENSES/, plus the binary-only RivieraWaves-based controller and PHY libraries under the SDK's Apache-2.0 alone; LVGL, TJpgDec, mbedTLS, littlefs and the codecs are not linked"
TOOL-017: "Open-flow HDMI works: the apicula fork at 1c2b6cb+ writes the OSER10 aux half, HWL, lane-0 FCLKSEL0/3 and ODDR LSROMUX_0 like Gowin, and at 93761f4+ its io2hclk map splits each long side at the block midpoint as the vendor does, so the build adds no fuses; the clock network was never the fault"
TOOL-018: "The AE350 firmware is built with xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC 15.2.0-1 (riscv-none-elf-gcc 15.2.0), configured --with-arch=rv32imac --with-abi=ilp32, so -march=rv32imac_zicsr_zifencei -mabi=ilp32 selects its default multilib: the boot ROM (firmware/boot/Makefile) links libgcc alone, and loaded programs (firmware/rt/rt.mk) link newlib 4.5.0's libc and libm, libstdc++ and libsupc++ with the runtime's own crt0 and syscalls; the compiler is found in ~/tools/xpack-riscv-none-elf-gcc-15.2.0-1/bin"
TOOL-019: "newlib 4.5.0's <sys/dirent.h> is an #error, so firmware/rt/include/sys/dirent.h stands in and syscalls.c's opendir, readdir, closedir and _stat always fail; rt.mk builds third-party LIB_SOURCES with their own flags"
TOOL-020: "The video unit's two-clock block RAMs read back wrong in every shape tried, most likely through the pixel clock's dead bridge spines (DEV-017); TinyNES keeps its frame buffers in the SDRAM and every video block RAM on one clock and in a 9-bit mode, the desk layer's cell store included"
TOOL-021: "gw_sh runs headless with LD_PRELOAD of the system libfreetype and QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen; regenerating the fork's chipdb needs GOWINHOME and msgspec from ~/tools/pydeps"
TOOL-022: "In two-wire mode TinyTang's tangload takes the .bin, the .fs bits packed eight to a byte MSB first (4,666,860 B for ae350_soc), from the card; TinyTang's fpgapipe passes the USB console through to the FPGA UART until DTR drops, and AE350 programs load through it at 186 KB/s; ae350run hands the link to the desk layer at TinyNES LINK"
TOOL-023: "The open flow times GW5AST-138C cells at speed grade C1/I0, derived as 1.25 x the .tm's C2/I1 table per DS1239E, with family-generic routing delays; IO, IOLOGIC (OSER10, ODDR, IDDR) and PLLs have no timing, so paths into the OSER10s, their FCLK and PCLK phase and every pin are untimed"
EMU-001: "libretro Nestopia 135dfa6 runs Castlevania on the A25 with checksums matching a PC build, at 23.16 ms a frame against 16.64 ms: 71.8 percent of full speed, with a 0.78 s start"
EMU-002: "libretro FCEUmm ac0d00a runs Castlevania on the A25 with checksums matching a PC build, at 19.07 ms a frame: 87.2 percent of full speed and 1.2 times Nestopia (1.8 times on the PC); it is the core TinyNES keeps"
EMU-003: "8.23 ms of FCEUmm's 19.14 ms XRGB8888 frame on the A25 is the 8-bit to XRGB8888 conversion; RGB565 cuts it to 5.01 ms and the frame to 15.85 ms, 104.9 percent; -O3 is slower and the prefetch and write-around bits do not exist"
EMU-004: "With its own driver in place of libretro.c, FCEUmm's core draws straight into the SDRAM frame buffers and Castlevania runs on HDMI at 10.82 ms a frame (max 12.02), 153.7 percent, every frame shown at the next vertical blank, checksums matching the PC"
EMU-005: "Played by hand with a Wii Classic Controller Pro on PMOD0 bus 1, nes_bench's PLAY=1 build ran Castlevania at 11.34 to 11.53 ms a frame (max 12.50) over three runs of 3,799 to 4,530 frames, no frame over the period, LATE 0 and MISSED 0; since entry 21 the player runs in link mode with TinyDesk over the game on a HOME tap"
EMU-006: "FCEUI_Initialize clears FSettings, leaving the five APU channel volumes at 0, so nes_bench's own driver mixed silence until it set them to 256 as the libretro driver does; with real sound Castlevania still runs at 153.5 percent, and the play build plays it on the I2S2 with no underrun"
EMU-007: "AccuracyCoin on FCEUmm ac0d00a under nes_bench: 84 of 146 with page 19 skipped, 83 with only its Misaligned OAM Behavior skipped, which hangs; TinyNES's seven patches and the Four Score turned off raise that to 90, the user saw 90 on the board, and the A25 benchmark slows from 10.93 to 11.08 ms a frame with identical checksums"
EMU-008: "Zelda II's title screen polls $2002 about 1,900 times a frame and FCEUmm rebuilt a 256-entry palette table on each resulting partial-line render, so its intro took 17.45 ms a frame on the A25 (1,690 of 1,800 frames over 16.64 ms); patch 0008 rebuilds the table only when its 16 palette bytes change, giving 9.95 ms, and Castlevania's benchmark 9.03 ms, with identical checksums"
WII-001: "Wii extensions use I2C address 0x52; write F0=55 then FB=00 to disable encryption, read six identity bytes at FA and six format-1 data bytes after setting pointer 00; NintendoExtensionCtrl waits 10 ms, 20 ms and 175 us at those steps and accepts Classic IDs 00/01 00 A4 20 00..03 01; buttons in bytes 4-5 are active low"
AUD-001: "The CS4344 takes a 256x MCLK at 2 to 50 kHz (MCLK 0.512 to 50 MHz, 45 to 55 percent duty) in I2S, with MCLK, SCLK and LRCK synchronous but no phase set; TinyNES counts all three from the 75 MHz bus clock, MCLK 12.5 MHz, Fs 48,828.125 Hz, measured 48,827.968 Hz on the board"
LORA-001: "The REYAX RYLR998 (UPC 612789267033) is a five-pin 3.3 V UART LoRa module, AT-command controlled, 820 to 960 MHz, -20 to +22 dBm out, -129 dBm sensitivity, 140 mA transmitting at +22 dBm; RYLR998_M4 has an I-PEX MHF4 connector instead of the built-in antenna; not fitted or tested here"

  title: "A core bitstream can carry AE350 RISC-V software, and tangload is how it reaches the board"
  status: SOURCED
  verified_date: 2026-10-03
  statement: "The GW5AST contains an AE350 hard RISC-V core, and a design may run software on it. That software is not a separate artifact at load time: it is compiled, written to a hex file, and read into a boot ROM inside the design with $readmemh, so it is synthesised into the bitstream and travels with it. Tang-Phosphor's AE350 images are built that way - scripts/build-ae350-ddr3.sh builds the boot ROM from software/ae350 alongside the gateware, and src/ae350/ae350_boot_rom.sv takes its INIT_FILE as ae350_boot.hex and fills the ROM from it at elaboration."
  consequence: "Deploying a core is therefore also how AE350 software reaches this board, and this project does run it: phosphortang.bin decodes audio on the AE350 (PHOS-001), so its RISC-V program arrived here inside that image by way of tangload. The boundary that matters is worth stating because it is easy to state wrongly in either direction - this firmware loads whole bitstreams and never loads AE350 code as an artifact of its own, yet the RISC-V code it runs is there because of what it loads. A description that omits the AE350 understates what the board is doing; one that says the firmware loads AE350 code implies a load path that does not exist."

The result answers CORE_ID 1, the same value the patched NES core answers, so the fpga probe reports one for both and cannot tell them apart."

Its logic is roughly a fifth of the patched NES core's (2781 LUT against about 12400, BSRAM 13 of 340 against 43) but its bitstream is only about 2.5 percent smaller, because Gowin frames and routing rather than logic dominate the image -- so it is a much smaller design, not a meaningfully faster tangload.

The same core-0 answer was seen once before, on 2026-10-04 in core-log cycle 12, with boot.tdsh renamed away. The FPGA therefore configures itself at power-up from configuration storage of its own, with a stock TangCore image, before the BL616 programs anything over JTAG."
  consequence: "The fabric is not empty at power-up; it looked empty only because boot.tdsh's tangload replaces the stock core within seconds, before most displays have locked. tangload programs SRAM and leaves that storage alone, which is why the stock core returns on every power cycle, and this project's cores live on the card, so every boot still reloads one: a cartridge is three commands in order, tangload to put the core in, fpga to confirm it answers, and nesload to stream the ROM. A core answering 0 is the sign that the boot chain did not run, which is how a missing /root/scripts/boot.tdsh shows up; restoring it is a tangput of scripts/boot.tdsh (TDESK-011 records how the desktop's Files app can delete it in two keystrokes).

  verified_date: 2026-10-12
  statement: "Gowin's RiscV_AE350_SOC Hardware Design Manual 1.3.1E requires the A25 core clock from the dedicated PLL path and keeps the AHB and APB clocks synchronous and below 200 MHz. On the GW5AST-138 the A25 runs at the frequency of PLL_R[0] CLKOUT1 whichever PLL output the netlist connects to AE350_SOC CORE_CLK, which Tang-PSX and Tang-Phosphor established with counted-cycle measurements (74.85 MHz and 49.85 MHz when CLKOUT1 was 75 and 50 MHz while 750 MHz was wired to CORE_CLK; 750.0000 MHz once CLKOUT1 was 750 MHz). The dedicated hop is the open-flow wire AE350_CORE_CLK_PLLR0. A TinyNES open-flow build with a 50 MHz input, a 750 MHz VCO (MDIV_SEL 15), CLKOUT1 divided by 1 into CORE_CLK and CLKOUT0 divided by 10 into the 75 MHz bus measured the A25 at 750.0000 MHz on every interval: the program stores mcycle to the fabric in a loop and the fabric pairs each value with a Gray-coded count of the 50 MHz board oscillator, so the result is independent of the PLL configuration."
  consequence: "750 MHz is the A25 rate this project has measured, not a proven ceiling; no source consulted states one. Put the CPU clock on CLKOUT1 and the bus clocks on CLKOUT0, keep the buses below 200 MHz, and confirm any CPU rate on hardware with a counted-cycle measurement rather than from the PLL settings or timing report. fpga/ae350_uart/ae350_uart.sv and tools/check_ae350_uart.py --clock implement the measurement."

  statement: "The AE350's bus clock pins are taken from the global clock network at row-0 taps X164Y0/CLK2 (AHB_CLK), X165Y0/CLK0 (APB_CLK), X174Y0/CLK0 (DDR_CLK) and X179Y0/CLK0 (RTC_CLK). Three open-flow TinyNES images (aeb25be2, c8091336, 4b081dd7) in which nextpnr fed those taps from branch GB20 (SPINE26, through X164, X172 and X180 Y0 GBO0/GT00) printed no boot ROM line on the UART over several loads, sending nothing or a repeating 7-byte pattern. Every image whose taps were fed from GB10 (SPINE25, through X165, X173 and X177 Y0 GBO0) ran: the a331d15 control, the off-bus video variant, the CPU_HOLD and CPU_TX_DROP diagnostics, all sweep seeds checked, and the failing netlist itself with nothing changed but its clock routing order (073d03bc, then 3937428f and the palette-bypass c60ef319), which booted and ran video_test. GB20 serves fabric flip-flops and OSER10s correctly: the HDMI pixel clock is on it and the picture holds sync. Ruled out: other nets on the tap wires (none in any build), AE350 configuration fuses (the block has none), port timing (DEV-015 added, no change), supply power (a powered supply, no change), and the HDMI PLLs and video logic (beacon builds with them and no CPU kept a clean UART)."
  consequence: "Which branch the bus clock gets depends on the order nextpnr's global router takes clock nets in; adding the HDMI pixel clock moved it to GB20. Until the cause is found, tools/build_ae350_soc.sh sets NPNR_GOWIN_CLK_FIRST=bus_clk, a temporary knob in the aquasock nextpnr fork at 7d1b131c that routes that net first so it lands on GB10, and fails if nextpnr did not apply it; tools/sweep.py now fails such a run too. The knob finds the net only by the name bus_clk, and after flattening Yosys names the net after the alphabetically first of its names, so an instance whose clock port joins it under a name sorting before bus_clk (an i2s_out instance called audio) renamed the net to audio.clk and the knob silently matched nothing; the script does not itself check the branch. Lead, not finding: Apicula's encoding of the GB20 pips into those taps, or nextpnr's model of that path; no Gowin build with the A25 clock on GB20 has been decoded to compare."

The same clock through `SPINE26 <= CBRIDGEOUT_BOTTOM2` at (27,96) and (81,96) clocks every one. Over seeds 1, 3, 6 and 8 of one TinyNES image whose HDMI pixel clock came from a CLKDIV at RIGHTSIDE[4] (HCLK escape wire 111), all 32 `pixel1` flip-flops sorted exactly by the spine feeding their branch: SPINE17 or SPINE18 stuck at 0, SPINE26 correct. The CLKDIV wire entering the centre mux at `(54,88) SPINE16` fed CBRIDGEOUT_BOTTOM0, entering at `(54,88) SPINE18` fed CBRIDGEOUT_BOTTOM2, and entering at `(54,93) SPINE9` (CBRIDGEOUT_TOP1) left the whole pixel clock dead in 8 of 8 seeds: no HDMI signal and no palette write acknowledged. A Gowin IDE 1.9.11.03 build of the same clock chain with flip-flops pinned across the device took `(54,88) SPINE19 <= UNK111`, `(27,94) SPINE16 <= CBRIDGEOUT_BOTTOM3` and `(27,96)`/`(81,96) SPINE24 <= CBRIDGEOUT_BOTTOM3`, and tapped SPINE19 and SPINE27. `SPINE25 <= CBRIDGEOUT_BOTTOM0` was on the silent bus-clock route of DEV-009."
  consequence: "The aquasock Apicula fork at cd3893f (epic/gw5ast138c) drops the three bridge pips above, the (27,94) pair also at (81,94), and lets the CLKDIV escape wires 105 to 112 enter the centre mux only at `(54,88) SPINE18`; tests/test_clock_bridge_138c.py holds the chipdb to that. tools/build_ae350_soc.sh fails unless the pixel clock reaches the spines only through `SPINE26 <= CBRIDGEOUT_BOTTOM2`. With both, 8 of 8 seeds and the unseeded image showed the whole picture. Lead, not finding: the vendor's SPINE16 output at (27,94) followed by taps on SPINE19 suggests the (27,94) bridge outputs are permuted against the spine names the chipdb gives them, which would also fit DEV-016's GB20 fault; the other bridge pips and entries remain unmeasured, so any new clock source or a design whose pixel clock needs more than SPINE26 needs the same measurement. Revised 2026-10-21 (core-log entry 41): with hdl-util's HDMI transmitter folded in, the pixel clock no longer fits one spine. Routing bus_clk first sent it through SPINE19+SPINE26 (+SPINE27 on five of eight seeds), none of them measured; routing the pixel clock first instead (NPNR_GOWIN_CLK_FIRST=pix_clk) put it on SPINE16+SPINE25 at every seed. Seed 7 of that sweep, timing-clean with bus_clk 81.0 MHz and pix_clk 91.47 MHz and the AE350 dedicated hop present, was loaded on this board: it showed the colour bars and then played Castlevania exactly as the DVI image did, so SPINE16+SPINE25 also clocks the pixel domain. The build's gate now accepts either SPINE26 alone or SPINE16+SPINE25 and still refuses every other set."

  status: VERIFIED
  verified_date: 2026-10-13
  statement: "On TinyNES images since core-log entry 18, and on TinyTang's open-flow desktop core too (on 2026-10-13 the user saw the card's desktop image glitch while the board was hot and clear again once it cooled, TinyTang core-log entry 50; nestang and Tang-Phosphor, both built with Gowin EDA, have not shown it), the HDMI picture intermittently shows thin horizontal lines of distortion and then flickers or cuts out, after anything from seconds to minutes, clearing by itself; it happens with only a USB-C power cable attached as well as with the PC driving the board, the user judging it 10 to 20 percent more frequent with the PC. Sound is unaffected. In a 559 s session of the seed-5 image (ae350_soc.bin a9cd9a78) with nes_bench's PLAY=1 DIAG=1 player, the user marked lines with X at 88 to 117 s and reported flicker and instability on a paused, still frame at about 143 s, which cleared during the pause; throughout, all 33,825 checked frames had PIXELS and BITS equal to the player's own count of the frame it handed over (which detects a pixel turning zero or non-zero, or a bit stuck in a frame, not one non-zero value changed for another), every vertical-blank period measured against mcycle was 12,500,000 core cycles within +-100 (the polling), and LATE, MISSED, audio underruns and drops were 0. In that image the 371.25 MHz serial clock pix_clk5 runs from hdmi_pll at PLL_L[3] (X1Y81) across the die on 23 E8 hops of general routing to X181Y81's HCLK and the OSER10s' FCLK, the OSER10s' PCLK is pix_clk on global branch GB20 (the route DEV-017 forces), and the TMDS clock lane is pix_clk driven straight into its ELVDS_OBUF rather than through an OSER10; six pix_clk clock pins, those of five pixel1 bits and two nx bits, are fed over general routing instead of the global network. In a second session of 298 s the user heated the FPGA's surface with a hair dryer from 32.8 C to 41.1 C and the picture glitched badly within one to two minutes, too fast to mark, then cooled it to 28 C and 25.1 C and it stayed clean; every internal check stayed as clean as in the first session throughout. A routed rebuild of TinyTang's desktop core at seed 2 with the current forks (which fails one hold check and so is not the card's desktop.bin) clocks its OSER10s the same way: the HDMI PLL at X1Y81, hclk5 over 22 E8 hops, PCLK on GB20 through SPINE26 <= CBRIDGEOUT_BOTTOM2, the clock lane from the pixel clock, and 17 pixel-clock pins off the global network."
  consequence: "The fault is temperature dependent, with its onset between about 33 and 41 C at the package surface. Ruled out: the SDRAM and its video channel losing or zeroing pixels, the line-buffer and pixel-stage logic sticking bits, the pixel clock's frequency and lock as seen per frame, and frame timing; a pixel changed to another non-zero value would not have been seen, but that alone would not cost the monitor its signal. The output path (palette lookup, TMDS encoder, OSER10s and their FCLK and PCLK, pins) remains the most likely place. Because TinyTang's desktop core shares the HDMI clocking and glitches when hot too, the lead is the shared open-flow HDMI clocking margin itself rather than a TinyNES-specific path, with TinyNES's A25 at 750 MHz and busy SDRAM only reaching that margin sooner; the heat test of desktop.bin (open flow) at 45 to 50 C was answered by that observation, while nestang (Gowin) hot remains untested. Static timing (TOOL-023) gives every data path into the OSER10s positive setup and hold margin at both ends of both flows' models, which leaves what no analysis covers, the 371.25 MHz FCLK's waveform after 9.86 ns of general routing (duty cycle and jitter) and the OSER10s' own requirements, as the lead. nes_bench's DIAG=1 build is the instrument for any change. Since core-log entry 25 the HDMI PLLs are at PLL_R[1] and PLL_R[3], the serial clock reaching the OSER10s in 2.12 ns instead of 9.86 ns, the encoder-to-OSER10 hold slack 0.756 ns instead of 0.46, and the TMDS clock lane an OSER10; the seed-10 image (ae350_soc.bin bafc2cf2) held the picture with every internal check clean for 308 s while the user heated the package to 57 C and then 62 C, with both Pmods unplugged, so the cause was the serial clock's long general route. That heat test was repeated on 2026-10-13 with the Wii controller on PMOD0 and the I2S2 on PMOD1 and the same seed-10 image (core-log entry 27): the picture stayed clean from 31 C to 69.8 C with no mismatch in any of 552 one-second samples, so the absent Pmod load was not what made the earlier image fail. Still open: the OSER10 reset fails Gowin's recovery check against the serial clock (TOOL-023), a one-time release at power-up, and the sub-ambient corner is unmeasured because canned air could not take the package below about 32 C, above its 30.9 C idle. TinyTang's open-flow desktop core now carries the same fix, proven on that board: its commit 9f3ddfb places pll_27 and pll_hdmi at PLL_R[1] and PLL_R[3], pins div5 to RIGHTSIDE[4], sends the TMDS clock lane through a fourth OSER10 and moves pll_nes to PLL_R[0], and the user held the desktop picture clean to 60.4 C where the image built from the old constraints was distorted by 55 C (TinyTang core-log entry 52)."

  statement: "The two modes TCTL-005 names are two different programs on the BL616, and only one runs at a time. A cold power-up with the dedicated power input connected, with or without the OTG cable, runs this project's firmware, and the host sees the TinyTang CDC (ffff:5454). A cold power-up with the OTG cable alone comes up instead as SIPEED's 'USB Debugger' FT2232 (0403:6010, serial 2025041420), with interface 0 as /dev/ttyUSB0 and interface 1 as /dev/ttyUSB1, and the CDC absent. Removing the power cable from a board already running TinyTang changes nothing: the OTG cable keeps it powered (BRD-005), the CDC stays enumerated under the same device number, and the console keeps answering. The same FT2232 is what a soft reset reaches after tangflash (FLS-002)."
  consequence: "Switching between the modes is a full power cycle -- both cables out, then the power input for two-wire or the OTG cable alone for one-wire -- and it restarts the FPGA as well as the BL616, so the FPGA comes back on the core it loads by itself (DEV-006) whichever mode follows. In one-wire nothing of TinyTang runs: no shell, no boot.tdsh, so no menu core, no desktop layer, no desktop, no keyboard handling and no F12, and HDMI shows the TangCore splash.

The schematic (docs/Tang_Mega_138K_Console_32001C__Schematics.pdf, sheet FPGA_EXT_CONN, Rev 1.3) names them J9 'SDRAM0 CONN.' and J10 'SDRAM1 CONN.' (with a note that the second can carry a GBA cartridge for a gamepad application): MiSTer-style SDRAM-module connectors whose pins 1-10, 13-28 and 31-40 go straight to FPGA I/O (SDRAM data, address and control; pins 29 and 30 are FPGA I/O too, which the Sipeed SDRAM module uses for its two DQM byte masks while litex-boards' MiSTer module definition assigns them nothing), with +5 V on pin 11 and ground on pin 12. A Raspberry Pi header instead has +5 V on pins 2 and 4, +3.3 V on 1 and 17, and ground on 6, 9, 14, 20, 25, 30, 34 and 39. One header holds the SDRAM module; the other is free. The connector carries no 3.3 V rail: +5 V on pin 11 and ground on pin 12 are its only supplies, which the user re-checked on the board on 2026-10-14."
  consequence: "A Raspberry Pi HAT fits the free header mechanically but must not be fitted to it: the HAT would take its supplies from FPGA I/O pins, its ground plane would short eight FPGA signals together, and the dock's +5 V on pin 11 would land on a HAT signal line, which on PiTFT HATs is a button that would then short 5 V to ground. A HAT can be used only through a pin-remapping adapter. The free header is otherwise usable as general FPGA I/O, with 5 V and ground on pins 11 and 12, provided the loaded core does not also claim those pins for SDRAM. The header holding a Sipeed SDRAM module has no spare I/O, because the module uses all 38, so another device's signals (an I2C controller's SDA and SCL, say) go on the free header or a PMOD socket. The free header is also the last general FPGA I/O left once both PMOD sockets are occupied, which is TinyNES's case -- the Wii Classic Controllers on PMOD0 and the Pmod I2S2 on PMOD1 -- so it is where a module with no socket left goes; its 38 pins would carry both halves of the PmodVGA (J1 red and blue, J2 green and sync, PMOD-006) on the one connector and leave both sockets free. A module needing 3.3 V on that header must have the rail brought from a PMOD socket, since the header has only +5 V and ground, and must take its ground return to the same socket. The header is not a declared socket, so the /tang.ini contract and the socket word at 0xc0 do not describe anything seated on it, and a core driving a module there hardwires the assignment instead: that second path is a decision for when VGA is requalified, not something to have two mechanisms for. The header's FPGA pin numbers have not been read out of the schematic since that sheet was removed from this repository on 2026-10-10. This came up with the Adafruit 2.2-inch PiTFT HAT (ILI9340, SPI, 320x240), which the user decided not to pursue with an adapter; the dock's 40-pin FPC parallel RGB LCD connector (sheet LCD_DPI_24BIT) is the intended display path and has not been set up."

Unknown module names, a vga_j1 without its vga_j2 partner, and flip for a module that is not flip-safe are refused rather than guessed. Tang-Phosphor's reference assigns the parser to the firmware that owns the SD card and the transport, naming Tang-Control there, while the registry of supported personalities lives beside the RTL that implements it."
  consequence: "That assignment lands here: Tang-Control was retired into TinyTang, and the parser is ports/bl616/tang_ini.c, applied after every tangload by ports/bl616/phosphor/pmod_sockets.cpp (PMOD-006 has its behaviour and the qualified layouts). TinyTang follows the contract with one deliberate exception: flip is applied as declared for any module, without the flip-safety refusal, because the user chose to defer that check."

  statement: "In Tang-Phosphor's merged player core, the one TinyTang loads as phosphortang.bin, the socket control word is 0xc0: bit 0 holds the renderer, bits 4-7 are the PMOD0 personality, bits 8-11 the PMOD1 personality, bit 12 marks PMOD0 seated upside down and bit 13 PMOD1, and a read adds the renderer's frame selector at 18:16. Personalities are 0 none, 1 oledrgb, 2 vga J1, 3 vga J2 and 4 rotary encoder (PMOD-006 adds 5, I2S2). Both sockets power up released, which is that project's safe state, so nothing is driven until a host declares it, and the host is the only party that validates a declaration, because it is the only party that knows what the user wrote. Tang-Phosphor's bring-up core uses the same layout at register 0x10, with 0x14 as scratch and a power-on default of the panel on PMOD0."
  consequence: "TinyTang declares the sockets from /tang.ini after every tangload of core 0x50 (PMOD-006); scripts/phosphor.tdsh no longer declares them. Bit 0 must not be used for stream routing, which moved to 0xa8 (PHOS-011).

The socket flip bit swaps the two signal rows; for a single-row Pmod ENC it also selects row 7-12 instead of row 1-6 without requiring the component side to face down. PmodVGA J1 carries red and blue, and J2 carries green and sync; the component-side-up seating exercised on this dock puts J1 on PMOD1 and J2 on PMOD0. Both sockets reset released, and the firmware must declare the fitted modules."
  consequence: "ports/bl616/tang_ini.c parses /tang.ini with no card or core access, so tools/tests/test_ini.sh checks it on the host, including that docs/tang.ini parses to 0x2410. It accepts none, oledrgb, encoder, i2s2, vga_j1 and vga_j2; the contract (PMOD-002) names only oledrgb, vga_j1 and vga_j2, and encoder and i2s2 are TinyTang's names for personalities 4 and 5, kept as TinyTang's own copy of Tang-Phosphor's numbering until the core reports its personalities. After every successful tangload, ports/bl616/phosphor/pmod_sockets.cpp asks the core for its ID and, for ID 0x50 at ABI 1.8 or later, writes the word to 0xc0 and reads it back, masking the frame selector at 18:16; other cores, including the bring-up core whose 0x04 is not an ABI, get nothing. A missing file or entry releases the socket; an unknown module, a flip other than yes or no, or one VGA half without the other releases that socket with a line-numbered console warning; unknown keys, other sections and keys outside [tang] are warned about and ignored. Flip is applied as declared for any module, without a flip-safety check, as the user directed. tangini shows the declaration and the loaded core's sockets, and tangini apply resends it. Verified layouts are I2S2 normally seated on PMOD0 with PMOD1 released (0x0050), encoder face up on PMOD1 row 7-12 with PMOD0 released (0x2400), OLED normally seated on PMOD0 with that encoder (0x2410), and PmodVGA with PMOD0 vga_j2 and PMOD1 vga_j1, neither flipped (0x0230).

The copy must run from .tcm_code with interrupts disabled, because once the first application sector is erased no instruction may be fetched from the application's XIP flash. The boot header carries magic at 0x00, 0x08 and 0x64, a CRC-32 of the first 252 bytes at 0xFC, and a body length at 0x84 counting bytes after the 4 KiB header region.

An earlier 0x80000 maximum, with staging at 0x100000, was Tang-Control's choice of layout (utils/firmware_image.h, whose own static assertions require only that the slot and the staging area fit below 0x200000), and the vendor loader does not enforce it: it booted images of 582,256 and 594,400 bytes, whose header body lengths exceed 0x80000."

There is no rename: rename is get, put under the new name, then rm. The firmware command patches and installs a BL616 image and the client waits for the device to disappear and return."
  consequence: "This is the capability being retired, and the list to consult when deciding what TinyTang should grow next. Two of these already have equivalents here - put and the firmware install, as tangput and tangflash - and the rest do not: TinyTang has a shell rather than a command protocol, so a client of this shape cannot talk to it unchanged."

The patched image is then sent over CDC with the firmware command, and the board is power-cycled afterwards, because the BL616 resets into its vendor loader and TangCore only returns on power-on. The client verifies the transfer by reading back the application's SHA-256 and comparing it with the local build, and it requires the transfer to sustain at least a megabyte per second while doing so."
  consequence: "This is the same header layout this project validates in FLS-002, now with the procedure and the verification step that surround it.

Its client exposes them through an rxstats command and can reset them."
  consequence: "This project reached the same conclusion independently - tang_fpga_uart.c drains the RX ring from an interrupt because the 32-byte FIFO cannot hold a burst at 2 Mbaud - and the counter set is worth adopting: resync_bytes and fifo_overflows are the two that would have diagnosed the framing and rate problems faster than the logs did."

The script language, uScript 1.1.1, provides variables, quoting, command substitution, arithmetic, if/elseif/else/endif, while/endwhile, for/endfor, functions with return statuses, pipes up to eight stages, and redirection; tdsh run passes no arguments to a script, and a script inherits the caller's variables. The line editor redraws command lines that wrap over several rows. tdsh_terminal_io_t has two optional members: columns(), the terminal's width read once per line, and read_byte_timeout(), with which the editor may ask the terminal for its width (ESC[6n); with neither, the editor assumes 80 columns. tdsh_board_int() in src/core/tdsh_board.c reads board configuration numbers as decimal or 0x hexadecimal, never octal (08 is 8 and 010 is 10). The ESP-IDF port makes network mode and network autowifi root-only. The release carries STANDARDS.md (TDSH-005)."
  consequence: "scripts/boot-cart.tdsh is written in this language and needs nothing beyond if, $?, and two variables; this port's commands are registered through tdsh_register_commands(). This port fills columns() from the width TinyDesk's Terminal window reports, through tdsh_bl616_terminal_set_columns() from the bridge's start() and resize(), and returns 0 at the console so the editor keeps 80. It offers no read_byte_timeout(), because at the console both the layer and a host terminal would answer the width query. Without columns() the editor wrapped the 76-column window at 80, putting four characters on the row after every full one. The port uses neither board configuration nor the network commands, so v0.1.5 needed no change here."

  status: SOURCED
  verified_date: 2026-10-06
  statement: "STANDARDS.md, added in TinyDesk Shell v0.1.5 for both projects, sets rules that apply to community ports. A port is described as 'Name, a port of TinyDesk Shell to platform' (TinyTang is the given example) and must not start its name with TinyDesk. It picks one 2-8 letter prefix for every name it owns -- C symbols, macros, port-only files, build switches, board keys -- recorded in the Community ports table of the TinyDesk Shell README, which lists TinyTang with the prefix 'not chosen yet' while the standard's own examples use tang. Files implementing an upstream interface are named tdsh_platform_<platform>.c, tdsh_fs_<platform>.c, td_hal_<platform>.c and tdsh_bridge_<platform>.c; a port defines no new td_ or tdsh_ symbols except entry points named tdsh_<platform>_<verb>. Upstream code is tracked as submodules at a release tag and never edited in place: a needed change is a patch in third_party/patches/ applied by an idempotent script, listed in THIRD_PARTY.md and matched by an upstream issue or pull request, and both repositories' host tests must pass at the pinned commit. Commands are lowercase without separators, one per subject with verbs as subcommands; upstream's command names and gpio, spi, i2c, uart, adc, pwm, usb, sd, eth, wifi and ota are reserved; a generic port command should carry the prefix. Scripts end in .tdsh and start with #!/bin/tdsh. The platform string is <platform>/<threading>, then ', <port name> <version or build id>'. Commit subjects read 'Area: what changed' without a full stop, and a pull request states what changed for users, the platforms it was built and run on, and that host tests pass without warnings. A system-wide boot script, displays drawn outside the terminal, and audio and media playback commands are listed as not standardised, with ports asked to open issues describing what they did. Limits in tdsh.h are listed as a known deviation because they are not wrapped in #ifndef."
  consequence: "This port already matches the platform string, the script header, the submodule rules and the tang prefix in practice. It does not yet match the file naming (td_bridge_bl616.c should be tdsh_bridge_bl616.c; fpga_frames.c, usb_cdc_bl616.c, tdsh_tang_flash.c, td_desktop_bl616.c and td_phosphor_app.cpp lack the prefix) or the command naming (blescan, blekbd and blemouse would be ble subcommands; crash and the usb* commands are generic); the standard asks for these when the files are next worked on. Declaring the tang prefix upstream, and an issue or pull request making TDSH_SCRIPT_TASK_STACK overridable (the 32 KB request behind BL6-009), are the obvious first contributions."

  statement: "tdsh run starts each script with a tdsh_script_job_t holding a full copy of the session, then a worker task with TDSH_SCRIPT_TASK_STACK of stack, then the script's runtime. Upstream v0.1.5 fixes TDSH_MAX_VARS 64, TDSH_VAR_NAME_MAX 32, TDSH_VAR_VALUE_MAX 256 and TDSH_SCRIPT_TASK_STACK 32768, giving a 19,096 B session on a 32-bit target (18,496 B of it the variable table) and a 19,352 B job, none overridable by a build. With those, on this board with Bluetooth and two devices connected and the desktop open, the heap had 48,208 B free with a 40,536 B largest block and about 7.7 KB outside it, and scripts opened from the Files app returned with no output: a 1,056 B tdsh_realloc of the script's line table (src/core/tdsh_script.c:189) was refused. TinyTang's carried patch, third_party/patches/tdsh/0001-configurable-script-limits.patch, wraps the four limits in #ifndef, keeping the upstream defaults and keeping each script's own session and variable copy; the header requires the same definitions in every component that includes tdsh.h, because the variable limits change tdsh_session_t's layout, and buffers include their terminating NUL. TinyTang sets TDSH_MAX_VARS=48, TDSH_VAR_NAME_MAX=32, TDSH_VAR_VALUE_MAX=128 and TDSH_SCRIPT_TASK_STACK=16384: the 7728 B variable table gives an 8328 B target session and an 8584 B script job, saving 10768 B per session against upstream defaults (8344 B and 8600 B on a 64-bit host). The comprehensive upstream fixture exceeds 32 variables and passes at 48; the usable name and value lengths are 31 and 127 bytes."
  consequence: "The larger table is a port choice, not a standard limit or a guarantee for all future scripts. CMake applies the patch idempotently before compilation and sets the same definitions for the shell, desktop, bridge and all C/C++ port sources. A 32-variable configuration was tried first and dropped because the upstream fixture needs more. A later desktop launch while the Phosphor window was open failed at xTaskCreate's 16384 B stack allocation before tangload could stop playback; playback was not an intentional core-load interlock. The app reserved 24576 B for 256 names regardless of file count; allocating 96 B per actual eligible file, capped at 256, reduces the tested 19-file catalog to 1824 B and lets those launches fit. The active-worker readouts support a bounded 16384 B future metadata/artwork budget for this configuration, not a reservation or a qualified decoder; docs/phosphor-memory-budget.md states the scope. The findings are upstream issue tinydesk-project/tinydesk-shell #2, whose author approved guards, consistent overrides and unchanged variable copies; remove the carried patch when a pinned release supplies the guards.

No allocations were refused after those tests and no crash record was present.

It is a terminal desktop: it draws overlapping text-mode windows with ANSI escape sequences, reads the keyboard and mouse back from the terminal, has no display hardware, and its core is portable C11. Its whole port surface is td_hal_t, four function pointers - read_byte returning the next byte or -1 without blocking, write returning the number of bytes accepted, millis, and sleep_ms - plus a context pointer. The Terminal app's td_term_backend_t has start(cols, rows), read, write, resize(cols, rows), user and set_user, and the upstream shell bridges pass the window's width from start() and resize() to the line editor through columns() (TDSH-004). It pins tinydesk-shell at 8456dd1 (TDSH-004), the same revision as this project's submodule. Against v0.1.4 the code this port builds changes only in include/tinydesk/td.h: TD_VERSION becomes 0.1.5 and TD_REPO_URL and TD_SHELL_REPO_URL point at tinydesk-project. v0.1.4 cut text at character boundaries (td_utf8_copy, td_utf8_pad, td_utf8_skip), kept the file name when the Editor saves, and reformatted every source with clang-format 16; its README lists TinyTang as a community port."
  consequence: "The port in ports/bl616/td_desktop_bl616.c is mostly a table of pointers over console calls this project already had, and the bridge in ports/bl616/td_bridge_bl616.c forwards the window width from start() and resize(). There is no second copy of the shell to keep in step. v0.1.5 needed no change to this port beyond the pins and the submodule URLs, which .gitmodules gives as tinydesk-project. Diffs across releases should be read after formatting both sides with the release's .clang-format, since otherwise the v0.1.4 reformatting hides the real changes."

This supports a persistent backend when its window closes, but reinstalling the backend after a port has stopped its task does not restart that task."

The defaults are TD_EDITOR_MAX 16384 and TD_EDITOR_UNDO 6144, about 25 KB, and both may be set from the build. A file longer than TD_EDITOR_MAX opens read-only with 'File too large: read-only'; an edit that would take the text past it is refused with 'The file is full'; a single change larger than TD_EDITOR_UNDO stays in the text but cannot be undone, and the oldest undo steps are dropped first when the history is full.

Display text is decoded as UTF-8 and reduced to the core's bounded ASCII font: typographic quotes, apostrophes, dashes, non-breaking spaces and ellipses are normalised to readable ASCII, and any other unsupported code point becomes a single question mark."
  consequence: "The one-to-one substitution rule matters: an unsupported code point must not change the character count, because the FPGA's text layout is positional. This is the same problem this project faces in its own text page, where the font is a fixed 128-entry bitmap table."

  verified_date: 2026-10-03
  statement: "A native FLAC track is transmitted as the fLaC marker, then STREAMINFO marked as the last metadata block, then the unchanged audio frames. The core skips every other metadata block, so large PICTURE or PADDING blocks do not delay a track's first frame over the UART, while the display side still reads them from the SD file. Each playlist entry is its own stream session. When the core advertises gapless append in capability bit 7, the loader starts the next entry as soon as the player reports its draining state - state 7 - rather than waiting for the FIFO to empty, and the core plays the new session's first sample on the sample period after the previous track's last, so same-rate tracks are sample-contiguous. The last entry still waits for completion, and older cores fall back to a completion handover."
  consequence: "Two separable ideas worth carrying forward: reordering a container's metadata so the payload can start sooner, which applies to any streaming format, and using a capability bit to decide between a fast handover and a safe one, which is how a new protocol stays compatible with an older core."

Its rate is play_rate, the AE350's last AE350_PLAY_RATE write, latched at stream start. Register 0xc0 (cpu_mode) routes the BL616's stream either to the AE350 (1) or straight to pcm_sink (0), and the core comes up with it at 0."

So TinyTang plays every file through the resident AE350 player and has no direct-stream command.

Built that way (863748 bytes, CRC 3d762d13) the player receives the whole file -- its log reads 'stream rx <size> first <magic>' -- and then never logs again: the loader stays in RUN, the RAM bridge counts ERROR responses with the first at address 0x00000000, and the bridge trace shows line fills at the top of the stack, then a fill at address 0, then fetches from the program entry at 0x40000000. With the code unchanged, 0 and 32 bytes of padding hang on every run and 16 and 48 bytes play on every run, so the trigger is the image layout and not the empty input entry.

It is a workaround, and any change to the player can move the layout and bring the hang back. The signature to recognise it by is the log stopping after 'stream rx' with the loader still in RUN (0x4020), a nonzero bridge error count (0x40b4) and a first error address of 0 (0x40c0).

  statement: "In Tang-Phosphor's resident gapless player experiment (step 3 of its entry 75 plan, built with BENCH_STREAM=2 by make -C software/rbhost bench-ondemand) the player never returns after a track. It extends the file-request mailbox at 0x4074, 0x4078 and 0x407c (USER(13..15)) so that a request of length 0 is a question selected by its offset and answered by the BL616 as one four-byte stream session, least significant byte first: 0 SIZE answers the current file's size, as the committed on-demand player already uses; 1 NEXT makes the BL616's queued track current and answers its size, 0 while nothing is queued, or 0xffffffff (STOP) when a stop is pending; 2 POLL answers 1 when a stop is pending and otherwise 0. A pending stop is answered once, to whichever of NEXT and POLL asks first. The player asks NEXT about every 50 ms while idle and POLL every 100 ms while decoding, keeps one request outstanding, reads each track in 64 KiB chunks at the file's own offsets, and longjmps out of the codec on a stop. It publishes its state in its result words: USER(0) at 0x4040 the marker 0x52455331 (RES1), USER(1) at 0x4044 tracks begun, USER(2) at 0x4048 tracks finished, USER(3) at 0x404c the latest finished track's samples, and USER(4) at 0x4050 that track's decode status, TRACK_ABORTED for a stopped one; a track counts as finished once all of it has been handed to the FPGA player. Same-rate tracks share one open play stream and so follow without a gap; a track at another rate waits for the stream to end and opens a new one."
  consequence: "While a resident player runs, the loader result at 0x402c is no longer a track's result, since the program does not return; a track's outcome is read from 0x4050 and its completion from 0x4048. The SIZE question is the only part of this contract in committed firmware (core-log entry 47); NEXT, POLL, STOP and the status words exist only in this record now, so a revival re-implements them on both sides from it and Tang-Phosphor remains the owner of the player's side."

  statement: "TinyTang's half of the PHOS-012 experiment settled these points in design. Residency is the loader in RUN (0x4020 bits 7:0 = 0x03) together with RES1 at 0x4040; neither alone suffices, because a trap and an ordinary program also leave the loader state and result words behind. The player is sent only when it is not resident, and after sending, the BL616 waits up to 2 s for RES1 before reading any counter, so it does not read a previous program's result words. A track is numbered as tracks begun plus one, read just before it is queued, and is over when tracks finished reaches that number, compared as a signed 32-bit difference for wraparound; this keeps a stopped track's late finish, published after the next track is queued, from passing for the new one. A stop pauses the sink at once (0x78 bit 0), clears the queued track, sets the pending stop, and serves the mailbox until the player takes it, so the player stays loaded; a player that has not taken the stop in 2 s is halted by the AE350 restart (0x43f0) as before. The file server keeps copies of the current and queued paths, since the caller's buffers change between tracks. One defect was found in review and not fixed: when a resident player is already running but the BL616 did not start it in this boot, for example after a BL616 reset with the FPGA left running, the mailbox baseline is never taken and stays 0, so a stale sequence in the mailbox would be served as a new request."
  consequence: "A revival of the resident player should carry these rules over and take the mailbox baseline whenever it finds a player it did not start. Tang-Phosphor's own notes set the order of work: the resident start failure of PHOS-007 is unexplained and a player that never returns exercises the RAM path far longer, so its RAM bridge experiment should be settled first; a rate change between tracks restarts the stream muted and must be reconciled with the I2S2 path's muted rate transition (Tang-Phosphor entry 78); and qualification needs both repositories together, the format sweep, a time to first sample against entry 76's 2.7 s, and a gapless check across same-rate tracks.

Tang-Control is this project's author's fork of nand2mario's TangCore firmware-bl616 (66 of its commits are his), and TinyTang started from its board layer, so TinyTang descends from TangCore: its board knowledge was learned there, the BL616-to-core UART protocol is his design read from nestang (PROT-001), and the NES core is his nestang carried as patches. No other TangCore source file is in the tree. THIRD_PARTY.md names that lineage, the vendored programmer with openFPGALoader behind it, both TinyDesk submodules at their pinned MIT commits, nestang's iosys_bl616.v read as a specification but not copied (GPL-3.0), the Bouffalo SDK and the components linked from it (TOOL-016), and colibri (PROV-003).

Choosing MIT gives up Apache-2.0's express patent grant, and means GPL-3.0 gateware from Tang-Phosphor cannot be copied into this tree. The sentence in THIRD_PARTY.md that must stay true is the one about the core UART protocol: it was read from a GPL-3.0 source as a specification and reimplemented, and that is what keeps a GPL-3.0 reading from becoming an unlicensed copy. Any file vendored from here on needs a line in THIRD_PARTY.md and a record here. The README once called TinyTang 'from-scratch' and said it did not 'inherit from TangCore', which was inaccurate; since 2026-10-06 README.md and THIRD_PARTY.md state the lineage and every Apache-2.0 file with its author.

Pins 6 and 7 must stay unconnected, because they are the core UART link. Pin 1 must not reach a 3.3 V adapter. It is also the configuration JTAG, not the AE350's debug JTAG.

With nothing on it the radio received a phone and a Logitech K950 at arm's length, the K950 at -76 to -94 dBm, and connected to the K950, but some connection attempts ended with HCI status 0x3E (connection failed to be established), each cleared by trying again; the Xbox Wireless Controller read about -70 dBm held against the board and -83 dBm further away, and its connections failed repeatedly with 0x3E. On 2026-10-10 a 2.4 GHz 6 dBi antenna was fitted to U35 through a U.FL/IPEX to RP-SMA pigtail, and the same controller then read -33 dBm, with the 0x3E failures and wedged connection attempts gone."
  consequence: "This board's Bluetooth reliability depends on that antenna: a board without one works only close up, and the bare board's failures (0x3E at connect, failed first encryption) look like protocol problems while being signal. If the antenna is ever removed or the board replaced, expect those failures back before suspecting the firmware. A client must still treat 0x3E as retryable rather than as the device refusing. Seating the U.FL connector on the dock's underside is a blind job."

  status: VERIFIED
  verified_date: 2026-10-05
  statement: "The SDK selects the BL616's Bluetooth controller by CONFIG_BTBLECONTROLLER_LIB. ble1m10s1bredr0 is the all-roles build: central, peripheral, broadcaster and observer, 10 connections, no BR/EDR, and the one examples/btble/central uses. ble1m0s1bredr0 has no central and no observer role and one connection, and ble1m0s1sbredr1 adds BR/EDR but still has no central role. The stack is brought up in the order examples/btble/central uses: rfparam_init, btble_controller_init, hci_driver_init, then bt_enable, whose ready callback reports the result; there is no call to shut the controller down again. CONFIG_BT_SETTINGS defaults to 0, in which case the host keeps nothing in flash, so the host alone keeps pairing keys only until reset. Built into this firmware, against the same tree without Bluetooth, ble1m10s1bredr0 with CONFIG_RF 1 grows the image from 346,160 to 582,256 bytes (+236,096: the controller library 113,954, the host stack libblestack 69,615, libbl616_phyrf 35,744, librfparam 6,639, about 10 KB else), shrinks the linker's ram_memory region from 447 KB to 415 KB, adds 17.4 KB of .bss and 0.8 KB of ITCM, and cuts the heap available at boot (__HeapLimit - __HeapBase) from 192,196 to 139,588 bytes."
  consequence: "proj.conf sets CONFIG_BLUETOOTH 1, CONFIG_BTBLECONTROLLER_LIB ble1m10s1bredr0, CONFIG_RF 1 and CONFIG_BLE_USE_MAC2 0, because scanning and connecting need the observer and central roles. ports/bl616/tang_ble.c starts the stack on the first Bluetooth command, or quietly after the boot script when pairings are saved on the card (BLE-012), so a board that never uses Bluetooth runs as before; once started it stays up until reset. The image no longer fitted the old 0x80000 slot, which is why the slot grew (FLS-002).

  statement: "The Logitech K950 keyboard (the keyboard of the MK955 Signature Slim set), in Bluetooth mode rather than on its Bolt receiver, is a HID over GATT device on Bluetooth LE advertising as 'Logi K950'. It uses a random address that increases by one each time it is put into pairing mode by holding an Easy-Switch key (seen as DB:88:A7:81:D9:CF to D9:D4). It accepts Just Works pairing at security level 2. Its primary services are 0x1800, 0x1801, 0x180A, 0x180F (battery), the HID service 0x1812 at 0x001F-0x004D, Logitech's 0xFD72 and a 128-bit vendor service from 0x005B. In the HID service, HID Information is at value handle 0x21, Boot Keyboard Input at 0x23 (notify, CCC 0x24), Boot Keyboard Output at 0x26, the Report Map at 0x28, Reports at 0x2A, 0x2E, 0x31, 0x34, 0x38, 0x3C, 0x40, 0x44 and 0x48 (notifying at 0x2A, 0x34, 0x38, 0x3C, 0x40 and 0x44), the Control Point at 0x4B and Protocol Mode at 0x4D. Writing 0 to Protocol Mode puts it in boot protocol, which reads back as 00, and it then sends the standard 8-byte boot report: modifiers, a reserved byte and six keycodes."
  consequence: "The boot report is byte-for-byte the format the wired keyboard link carries, so the existing translation in tang_key.c applies to it unchanged. Because the address changes with every pairing, a new pairing needs the device found in pairing mode; once paired, the bond on the card brings it back after a reset without that step (BLE-012). In boot protocol it still sent one 19-byte notification on 0x0044 beginning FF 04 00 01 01 01, presumably Logitech's own report, which a client should ignore."

A different failure has the same surface: when a device has forgotten its key, for example because it was put back into pairing mode, the board's stored key can never encrypt again. Then the security callback may report error 2 (PIN_OR_KEY_MISSING), or may not fire at all, the connection showing only 'connected; requesting encryption' followed by HCI 0x3E with no 'encrypted' line; on the Xbox Wireless Controller that repeated on every attempt until the key was dropped by hand."

The keys are stored unencrypted, so whoever holds the card can impersonate the board to those devices. An error-8 failure goes back to waiting and the next connection retries it, so it needs no handling, and it must not be used to drop a key: error 8 also arrives on signal alone, and dropping on it threw away good pairings. hid_security_changed() drops the stored key on PIN_OR_KEY_MISSING only, through hid_drop_key(), leaving the slot armed so the next connection pairs afresh. The silent case, a connection that reaches 'requesting encryption' and dies without ever logging 'encrypted', is not handled, and only blekbd forget (or blemouse forget) clears it; the narrow trigger, if one is added, is that sequence on a bonded slot, not the HCI code alone, because 0x3E is also a signal failure."

Revised 2026-10-11 (core-log entry 10): the record said a failed first encryption needs no special handling, without the stale-key case. Revised 2026-10-13 (core-log entry 18): the card's folders moved under the shell's home, /root (cores, scripts, music, ae350, ble and demos, with ROMs in /root/data/nes), and the firmware's paths followed; the paths above are the new ones."

  statement: "This SDK builds FreeRTOS with heap_3, so heap use is read from its own allocator, kfree_size() and g_kmemheap.heapsize in components/mm/mem.h; the allocator keeps no lowest-ever counter, so a transient peak is not measured. Starting the Bluetooth stack takes about 15.8 KB of heap (84,120 B free before and 68,292 B after in firmware 1cea7b9-dirty.a296b3b, 82,364 and 66,536 in a later one), and a connection about 700 B; reconnects return free heap to the same figure, so they do not leak. With both devices connected, 64,704 B of the 124,768 B heap stayed free, with a 40,536 B largest block, before and after seven cartridge loads and a desktop session. An earlier reading of 41,764 B free after a desktop session was not the desktop: every tangload, including the boot script's, leaked 4 KB (BL6-009) until that was fixed."
  consequence: "Bluetooth with two devices leaves about 65 KB of heap and a 40 KB largest block for everything else. A request near that size, such as the 32 KB script stack TinyDesk Shell asks for, can still fail once the heap fragments, which is why worker stacks are capped (BL6-009). `ble` reports free heap and the largest block."

  title: "Xbox Wireless Controller over Bluetooth LE: pairing mode, pairing parameters and GATT map"
  status: VERIFIED
  verified_date: 2026-10-11
  statement: "The Xbox Wireless Controller is a HID over GATT device on Bluetooth LE with a public address (this one 78:86:2E:BB:45:79, Microsoft), advertising appearance Gamepad (0x03C4) and the HID service UUID 0x1812; it does not answer a Classic BR/EDR inquiry. BlueZ reads its PnP ID as USB 045E:0B13, version 0x0509. Its light blinks fast in pairing mode and slowly when idle and not pairing; pairing mode lasts a few minutes. Its LL features include LE Encryption, Data Packet Length Extension and LL Privacy, and its Peripheral Preferred Connection Parameters (handle 0x0007) are interval 6-12 (7.5-15 ms), latency 0, supervision timeout 300 (3 s); its ATT MTU is 23. Its Pairing Response is IO capability NoInputNoOutput, Bonding, no MITM, Secure Connections, key size 16, wanting EncKey and IdKey from the initiator and offering EncKey and IdKey as responder: against a bonding request it returns the intersection with what the initiator offered, and against BlueZ's request it negotiated initiator EncKey only (which LE Secure Connections ignores, so the host sends no keys) and responder EncKey and IdKey, after which it sends Identity Information and Identity Address Information. Its HID service is at 0x0016-0x0023: HID Information value 0x0018, HID Control Point 0x001A, Report Map 0x001C (283 bytes), an input Report at 0x001E (notify and read, CCC 0x001F) and an output Report at 0x0022 (write only); 0x0003 is the GAP Device Name, 'Xbox Wireless Controller'. A 128-bit vendor service 00000001-5F60-4C4F-9C83-A7953298D40D sits at 0x0024-0x002A, with characteristics 00000002-... at value 0x0026 (read), 00000003-... at 0x0028 (read) and 00000004-... at 0x002A (write). The controller sends input notifications on 0x001E on its own: about every connection event from the start of a link, before any CCC write, and even on an unencrypted link after pairing failed; on an encrypted link with BlueZ the first arrived 45 ms after encryption. It sends no ATT requests of its own to the host."
  consequence: "The controller works as a plain LE HID device on a mainstream host: with BlueZ 5.85 it paired with LE Secure Connections Just Works, bonded, and delivered 701 sixteen-byte reports while the user pressed buttons, with no vendor-service access and no host-side GATT server involvement. Bluepad32's uni_hid_parser_xboxone.c likewise performs no vendor write. Subscribing is not what starts its reports, so a host that sees no reports after encryption is not failing to subscribe. Commands fired at it from this board mean something only while it blinks fast. Its behaviour on this board's host is BLE-017, and its input report is BLE-016."

  title: "Xbox Wireless Controller on this host: no report has ever arrived, and two ways the link ends"
  status: VERIFIED
  verified_date: 2026-10-11
  statement: "On this board the controller has never delivered an input report, in two failure forms. In the first, seen on the bare jack (BLE-001) before the antenna was fitted, a fresh pairing at least once ran the whole setup -- discovery, the subscription with CCC 0x001F reading back 01 00, the full Report Map, Exit Suspend written to the Control Point and accepted, ready -- and the controller then sent no notification with buttons held and ended the link with HCI 0x13 (remote user terminated); at other times it ended the link earlier. In the second, seen consistently after the antenna was fitted, it bonds with LE Secure Connections on a link created at interval 40 (50 ms), latency 0 and supervision timeout 400 (4 s), never asks for other connection parameters, and answers no ATT request once the security procedure completes: a read of 0x0003 sent before security returned 22 bytes and then 2, 'Xbox Wireless Controller', while the same read after it never came back, primary discovery found 0 services, and a later bt_gatt_read() returned -ENOTCONN (-128) because the host held the link to be gone. With nothing issued after encryption -- no discovery, no subscription, no bond save -- the link was reported alive at 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 s, none of five probe reads was answered, and it ended 8750 to 8801 ms after bonding with HCI 0x08, a supervision timeout, placing the controller's last packet near 4.75 s. On the next connection the controller reports error 2 (PIN_OR_KEY_MISSING), so it did not keep the bond this board saved. Once a bond exists it answers an unencrypted read with ATT 0x05 (Insufficient Authentication). An ATT MTU exchange sent while security was in progress drew ATT 0x0E (Unlikely Error) and HCI 0x3E on four attempts out of four. The second form is unchanged with host privacy off (CONFIG_DISABLE_BT_HOST_PRIVACY), which stops this board offering its identity key: paired, encrypted at level 2, 0 services, HCI 0x08, then error 2, twice, on firmware bb64cbb-dirty.34f7c44. With LE legacy pairing as well (smp_set_auth(BT_SMP_AUTH_BONDING), firmware cb9c96c-dirty.1055ce0) a third form appeared, repeated over six pairings: the controller encrypts, bonds and answers discovery after encryption, all five primary services including HID at 0x0016-0x0023; it then asks for its preferred parameters, which this board grants (interval 12, 15 ms; latency 0; timeout 300, 3 s), and the link ends with HCI 0x08 about one supervision timeout later, the next connection getting error 2. BlueZ moves the same controller to the same 15 ms and 3 s on its own initiative, with LE Connection Update, and receives 676 further reports. The update is not the cause: the controller asks this board for interval 6-12, latency 0, timeout 300 shortly after pairing, through the host's le_param_req, and with the request refused (firmware 9235969-dirty.ac83602) the link stayed at 50 ms and still ended the same way, discovery stalling after one or two answers, over three pairings in one 45-second watch. Since legacy pairing, most first connection attempts from this board end in HCI 0x3E (connection failed to be established) at -24 to -33 dBm, the controller never answering the board's connection; BlueZ connected to it first time on every attempt. An HCI trace of this board (bletrace, firmware 68ca825-dirty.c2a36fd) shows both: in a 0x3E attempt the board's LE Create Connection matches BlueZ's (scan 60/60 ms, interval 30-50 ms, public addresses) apart from a 4 s supervision timeout against BlueZ's 420 ms, the controller reports the connection complete at 50 ms, and about six connection events later it gives up with 0x3E, so the controller never heard from the peer at the link layer; and in every encrypted session the controller's last data packet arrives about 0.15 s after it sends its Identity Address Information, just after pairing completes on both sides, with the link timing out about 8.7 to 9.7 s after connection. At that same moment, on receiving the controller's IRK, this board's host issues LE Add Device To Resolving List, LE Set Privacy Mode and LE Set Address Resolution Enable (bt_id_add() in host/hci_core.c, used whenever the controller reports a resolving list), which BlueZ never issues during its session with the controller."
  consequence: "This is an open defect. On a working host (BLE-015) the controller sends reports within 45 ms of encryption with nothing asked of it, so on this board it is silent, not merely unsubscribed; and since it answers ATT before encryption and nothing after, the fault lies in the encrypted link or in how the controller judges the pairing, not in GATT. Ruled out: signal (antenna fitted), connection parameters requested by the controller (none), the ATT MTU (BLE-016), the order of the GATT setup steps (setup never starts), the vendor service (BLE-015), legacy pairing as the mode in use (the bond is LE Secure Connections), this firmware's post-pairing work (the hands-off run issued none), and this board's identity-key distribution and private address (privacy off changed nothing). LE Secure Connections is involved but is not the whole fault: with legacy pairing the controller answers after encryption, so the silence from encryption onwards is specific to Secure Connections on this board, while the link still fails a few seconds after pairing whether its parameter request is granted or refused, so the update is ruled out too. An HCI trace on this board (`bletrace`, read with tools/ble_trace_to_btsnoop.py and btmon) now shows the failure point: the controller stops sending data as pairing completes, which is also when this board's host turns on address resolution in its controller for the controller's IRK; that reconfiguration is not the cause: with public-address devices kept out of the resolving list (firmware 750bb0a-dirty.2c19591) no resolving-list, privacy-mode or address-resolution command reached the controller, and the controller still went silent at the same point in four encrypted sessions. An ATT MTU exchange sent once encryption is up, BlueZ's first operation (firmware 2a3e59b-dirty.e957079), is answered (MTU 23) and changes nothing either. In every traced encrypted session the controller's last two data packets are a GATT answer and an L2CAP Connection Parameter Update Request, sent about 0.1 s after pairing completes; it never sent that request to BlueZ, which moved it to 15 ms on its own about 2 s in, so the controller treats this board's link differently before any GATT difference arises. Creating the link at BlueZ's 45 ms and 420 ms and asking for a 251-octet data length once connected (firmware ba80bbf-dirty.8977791) changed nothing: the controller still asked for new parameters and fell silent at the same point. The controller accepted every LE Set Data Length command, but no LE Data Length Change event ever arrived, where BlueZ's adapter reported 251 octets each way, so whether this board's controller completes the exchange with the controller is not known. With BlueZ's own pairing flags as well (Bonding, MITM, Secure Connections, CT2; firmware b6a8490-dirty.f783aa8) this board's host traffic matches BlueZ's packet for packet through the moment of failure: encryption, an MTU Exchange Request, the controller's Identity Information and Identity Address Information, and no keys from the host. BlueZ's request is answered within 90 ms and the reports start; this board's is acknowledged at the link layer and never answered, and the controller's link layer stays up about 4.8 s more. The fault is therefore below the HCI, in the BL616's binary controller (libbtblecontroller_bl616_ble1m10s1bredr0.a), consistent with the 0x3E connects and the unreported data length change. The SDK in use is nand2mario's fork at 7f44f9e (2025-04-27); upstream bouffalolab/bouffalo_sdk has released components/wireless/bluetooth/btblecontroller about twenty times since, up to version 2.3.36 on 2026-10-03, with release notes that do not say what changed. That library (2.3.36, 8a3df34, 1,856,570 bytes, sha256 cf8b688b694bb96225d736c412350ea3c737f7a872bb755bb37ef267a2e64e23, version string lib_version_btblecontroller_1.6.210) keeps the controller API and the onchip HCI packet layout of this fork's, apart from bt_onchiphci_hanlde_rx_acl renamed bt_onchiphci_handle_rx_acl and upstream's host glue sending every command with dest_id 0, and it links against this fork's host with a shim for those two; but the board then hangs, with USB gone and no crash record, as soon as the radio is started. Upstream has also changed the BL616 PHY library (drivers/soc/bl616/phyrf, three releases since) and the BL616 linker scripts that size the controller's exchange memory (__EM_SIZE), so the controller cannot be taken alone: using it means taking upstream's radio layer, controller, PHY, RF parameters, memory layout and host glue, together. Still different from BlueZ and untested: who starts the parameter update (the controller asks this board; BlueZ updated before it asked); the pairing request's IO capability and MITM flag (BlueZ: KeyboardDisplay, MITM, CT2; both still end in Just Works); the responder key distribution this board asks for; the link layer, where BlueZ's adapter extended the data length to 251 octets at connection and used a 45 ms interval with a 420 ms supervision timeout; and the BL616 controller's handling of LE Secure Connections encryption, which no other device here has been shown to use. Do not issue an ATT MTU exchange while security is in progress."

The move to Bouffalo SDK 2.3.36, made for this pad's controller library, changed nothing -- the pad pairs, encrypts, bonds and then goes silent exactly as the forms above record -- so the fault is confirmed to be the BL616's binary controller library and not the host, the SDK version or anything this project changes; rfparam_init() is called exactly as the SDK's own examples call it, so the radio path is not misconfigured either.  Two further facts close the question of what a working pad would have bought: the BL616's core link carries no command to send input into a core (ports/bl616/tang_fpga_link.h, core-log entry 29), so a BLE pad could only ever have driven TinyDesk and never a running core; and no other BLE-HID gamepad was available to test, so whether this host path handles gamepads at all is untested, while a BLE keyboard and mouse both pair and report (core-log entry 31)."

The other scripts in tools/ generate test files or check the tree. The retired Tang-Control helpers are recorded separately in TCTL-010.

One command's console output is cut off after about 4.5 KB, pacing the output does not help, and shell redirection does not capture tdsh_printf, so `bletrace dump` is fetched in ranges (`bletrace dump <from> <count>`, 80 packets at a time) and the pieces joined. tinytang_run.py's --seconds is a window for streaming output after the command, not a delay, and Bluetooth log lines are handed out once, so its output is saved to a file whole before it is filtered."

  statement: "The CDC console is one byte stream with one reader at a time: at the shell prompt a byte is part of a command line, while the desktop runs it is a keystroke into whichever window has focus, and while a command such as tangput runs it is that command's data. Nothing on the wire distinguishes them. The firmware therefore answers a status probe that never reaches any reader: the USB receive interrupt takes ESC [ ? 7 7 n out of the input, and the next task to read the console replies ESC [ ? 7 7 ; <state> n, with 1 at the shell prompt, 2 while the desktop runs and 3 for a command that reads the console. A command that reads nothing does not answer until it ends."
  consequence: "Before the probe the console had no such answer, and a raw upload sent while the desktop held it became keystrokes: on 2026-10-04 a 131088-byte ROM produced root-directory entries named new.txt and New folder with binary data for names and damaged the allocation table until /cores, /scripts and /roms were unreachable, with no error on either side; the recovery is fsck.vfat from a PC before any reformat. The first guard, in tools/tinytang_put.py, looked for the desktop's drawing on USB and sent a carriage return to wake a prompt. Once the desktop's drawing left USB (USB-007) it could not see the desktop, its carriage return was Enter in whatever window had focus, and with the Terminal window open the shell in it printed a real prompt to USB, so the guard could pass with the desktop up. USB-007 suggested following the desktop's start and exit lines instead; asking the board was chosen because it types nothing and does not depend on having seen the start of the session. tools/tinytang_console.py's require_shell() is used by tinytang_put.py, tinytang_flash.py, phosphor_format_sweep.py and tinytang_run.py, which had no guard before and now asks before each line, so a second command waits for the first to end. No answer is treated as not ready, which also covers a firmware that predates the probe; flashing the first firmware with the probe needed the old guard and the user's word that the console was at a prompt. The probe is matched within one USB packet, so a lone Esc typed at a terminal is not held, and tangput turns the matching off while it receives, because a file may contain the sequence."

Loading a core is an SRAM load and must use the .fs stream; a raw .bin is shifted in but does not start the FPGA, which leaves it unconfigured and the UART silent. The FPGA UART is interface 1, /dev/ttyUSB1, at 2,000,000 baud with the same 0xAA len_hi len_lo type framing the BL616 uses: the core-ID request AA 00 01 01 was answered AA 00 02 01 00, core 0. A core speaks only when asked, so four seconds of listening at 2 Mbaud and at 115200 with nothing sent returned no bytes; that silence is not evidence either way."
  consequence: "One-wire is for the FPGA alone: identifying it, loading a bitstream into SRAM, and the 0xAA and extended (0x10) protocols from the host, which is how Tang-Phosphor developed its core (tools/fpga_uart.py, scripts/flash-otg.sh, scripts/uart_probe.py). It cannot see TinyTang or TinyDesk at all: the CDC, the shell, the status probe, tinytang_put/run/flash.py, phosphor, tangload and nesload all need two-wire. It also cannot inspect a fault reached under TinyDesk, because getting into one-wire takes a cold power-up that puts the FPGA back on its own core, and a core loaded over one-wire is replaced at the next two-wire boot when boot.tdsh loads the menu core. The port is opened with DTR and RTS held low so opening it moves no control line; with the BL616 running the debugger, the host is the only other party on the UART."

  consequence: "This is the loop for working on a core by itself: rebuild, SRAM-load, peek and poke its registers, stream to it, all without touching the card or reflashing anything, and a power cycle with the power input returns the board to TinyTang with the core gone, since SRAM loads are volatile. At 2 Mbaud the link moves about 85 KB/s, so the player upload dominates; the extended channel's baud switch to 5 Mbaud (EXTCTL-001 opcode 0x03) is the next speed-up and has not been tried in one-wire.

  statement: "A Raspberry Pi Pico 2 running CMSIS-DAP JTAG-probe firmware is wired to the FPGA module's 8-pin header U1201 (PSX-004) and plugs into the host as a separate USB device, 2e8a:000c, not through the BL616 or the FT2232. The user reports it set up and validated, and plugs it in on request. Tang-Phosphor's scripts/flash-pico.sh SRAM-loads a .fs with oss-cad-suite's openFPGALoader -c cmsisdap --vid 0x2e8a --pid 0x000c -b tangmega138k --freq 2000000 (PICO_VID, PICO_PID and PICO_FREQ override); like flash-otg.sh it refuses a .bin, which does not start the FPGA (TOOL-012). The probe bit-bangs JTAG, its clock must stay at or below 2 MHz (4 MHz and up read garbage IDCODEs), and its 64-byte bulk endpoint makes a full bitstream take about 10 to 20 minutes. Tang-Phosphor's README names its real value as GAO, Gowin's internal logic analyser, over the module's debug connector. Tang-PSX found the same probe (lonehog/JTAGprobe, CMSIS-DAP v2; TCK GP19, TMS GP14, TDI GP18, TDO GP21) under OpenOCD 0.12.0 with IDCODE 0x0001081B, where openFPGALoader 0.13.1 could not open it; Tang-Phosphor's later openFPGALoader from oss-cad-suite read the same IDCODE through it."
  consequence: "This is the third way to reach the FPGA, beside the BL616's tangload in two-wire and the FT2232 in one-wire (TOOL-012, TOOL-013). Because it is its own USB device on its own header, it is not bound to the power-input choice that makes one-wire and two-wire exclusive (BRD-006, BRD-007): Tang-Control lists Pico 2 JTAG programming as part of its two-wire debug arrangement (TCTL-005), although Tang-Phosphor's README files flash-pico.sh under one-wire. So it is the candidate for JTAG access while TinyTang runs: GAO captures, a --detect or status read that checks a tangload's result independently of the BL616's own report, or a core load when the card or tangload is in question. It is too slow for routine loads; use tangload in two-wire or flash-otg.sh in one-wire. Two rules come from PSX-004: the probe shares TCK, TMS and TDI with the BL616, so it must be idle (or unplugged) whenever TinyTang runs tangload, and only pins 2 to 5 and 8 are wired to it, never pin 1 (about 4.4 V) or pins 6 and 7 (the core UART). A core loaded through it under TinyTang replaces the running core without the firmware being told, so the desktop layer and the Phosphor playback task do not know the core changed."

  title: "The open-flow desktop core drives HDMI and VGA with the apicula fork at 93761f4 or later and nextpnr rebuilt against its chipdb; the fault was the packer's IOLOGIC encoding and the cell-to-HCLK-block map, never the clock network"
  status: VERIFIED
  verified_date: 2026-10-11
  statement: "GW5AST-LV138PG484AC1/I0 revision C, open flow (yosys, the nextpnr-himbaechel fork, the apicula fork aquasock/apicula epic/gw5ast138c).  Before fork commit 1c2b6cb the packer wrote three things differently from Gowin EDA 1.9.11.03, each decoded with gowin_unpack and each fatal to HDMI on the board: (1) an OSER10's aux IOLOGICB was left empty, where the vendor writes CLKOMUX=ENABLE, LSRIMUX_0, OCLKCE=CE, WRFCLKSEL=UNK102 and the main half's FCLKSEL values -- at right-edge and bottom-edge cells, single-ended or differential, and in the fork's own io_ser oser10-default shape rebuilt today, which retracts fork commit 84dddea for OSER10; (2) an OSER10's main half lacked HWL=TRUE and carried LSROMUX_0, and a gearbox whose FCLK is on HCLK lane 0 lacked FCLKSEL0=HCLK0 and FCLKSEL3=HCLK0_ (lane 2 has no rows for them); (3) an ODDR's LSROMUX_0 was emitted as the int 0, which has no row, so the table's negative-key fuse was written instead ((21,66) on tile type 247, (11,134) on 245/232).  1c2b6cb fixes all three.  A fourth fault was in the fork's chipdb: gw5_hclk_arcs split each long side between its two HCLK blocks at the row-63 inter-HCLK bridge, so io2hclk served rows 55 to 61 -- among them (57,181), the red TMDS serialiser, K17/J17 -- from blocks 0 and 1, nextpnr routed that serialiser's FCLK through block 1 lane 2, and HDMI was blank unless FCLKSEL0=HCLK0/FCLKSEL3=HCLK0_ were hand-added at R58C182 and R59C182.  A Gowin sweep of one OSER10 along both long edges, decoded only, served rows 41 to 52 from blocks 0/1 and rows 55 to 64 from blocks 2/3, with no fuses in the bridge cell; rows 53 and 54 cannot host an OSER10.  The split is the block midpoint, row 54, and fork commit 93761f4 makes it so, moving rows 55, 57, 59 and 61 on both edges and nothing else.  With it nextpnr places all three TMDS serialisers on block 3 lane 2, which carries no lane-0 bits, and HDMI works; the vendor uses lane 0 of the same block.  The bottom side's split (column 90/91) is unmeasured."
  consequence: "TinyTang's tools/build_desktop_core_open.sh is the build of record; it needs the apicula fork at 93761f4 or later, its chipdb regenerated, and the nextpnr fork rebuilt against that chipdb (~/tools/rebuild-nextpnr.sh).  Its tools/desktop_open/build.sh packs with the plain gowin_pack and adds no fuses.  The design is TinyTang's fpga/desktop/ with top module desktop_top and no nestang patches; on that netlist every seed from 1 to 32 with pll_nes at PLL_R[0] fails timing, so its fpga/desktop/desktop.cst places pll_nes at PLL_L[0] and the build defaults to seed 2, producing desktop.89f3ae9350c4.bin (desktop.6639878beff9.fs), the card's /root/cores/console138k/desktop.bin since 2026-10-11 (7b21952ec575, the seed-17 nestang-netlist core, is kept as desktop.bin.pre-cleanup).  In that core the main clk reaches its 1199 sinks over fabric because the stock router refuses the MPLLCLKOUT0 to TLPLL0CLK0 hop, and it must stay so: every core that carried clk over TLPLL0CLK0, wholly (global resources only, setup and hold met) or in part (SPINE8 alone), loaded with a dead clk domain, because the chipdb's TLPLL0CLK0 to spine to quadrant-bridge model does not match the silicon (the centre SPINE8 to SPINE10 and SPINE16/18/19 are the same nodes as CBRIDGEOUT_TOP0..2 and CBRIDGEOUT_BOTTOM0/2/3, and Gowin's own build adds GT10 <- CBRIDGEOUT_BOTTOM0 at R28C87 and SPINE16 <- BRMDCLK1_BOT, which the chipdb does not model).  Writing PLL attribute 211 = 2 (DISABLE), the one PLL-attribute difference from Gowin, onto every PLL kills the HDMI pixel PLL too and must not be done.  hclk5 on fabric and the HCLK fabric entry work as they are, so this dark-HDMI fault needed no clock-network change; the later, separate thermal fault did (DEV-018), and TinyTang's desktop core now carries that fix, proven on that board: its commit 9f3ddfb places pll_27 and pll_hdmi at PLL_R[1] and PLL_R[3], pins div5 to RIGHTSIDE[4], sends the TMDS clock lane through a fourth OSER10 and moves pll_nes to PLL_R[0] so `clk` enters through TRPLL0CLK0, where the user held the desktop picture clean to 60.4 C against 55 C for the image built from the old constraints (TinyTang core-log entry 52).  The recipe above does not reproduce the card's image: apycula's chipdb is an untracked build product, nothing on this machine regenerates the 2026-10-11 database, and a rebuild with the fork at 93761f4 and that era's own nextpnr gives a different timing model and routes `clk` on global resources.  Its tools/build_desktop_core.sh (Gowin) is kept only as a comparison build, and fpga/hdmi_test/ with tools/build_hdmi_test.sh (HDMI_TEST_RED_BALL, HDMI_TEST_FREE_BALLS), tools/bitstream_tile_diff.py and tools/gowin_pack_transplant.py are the instruments that found this."

Revised 2026-10-13 (core-log entry 26): scoped the no-clock-network-change claim to the dark-HDMI fault, since the later thermal fault of DEV-018 did require a clock-network change. Revised 2026-10-13 (core-log entry 28): carried TinyTang core-log entry 52, the validated desktop fix and the finding that this record's own build recipe does not reproduce the card's image."

  statement: "Frame buffers written on the bus clock and read on the HDMI pixel clock came back wrong in every block RAM shape tried with the aquasock Apicula fork at 860ada4: 1-bit DPB blocks (64) read zero; 4Kx4 DPB blocks were per block either readable, zero, or missing bits 1 and 3; 2Kx9 DPX9B blocks read zero on all 8 placement seeds while a 512x9 DPX9B emphasis store on the same two clocks read correctly. The palette lost its entries from 256 up. Replacing the frame buffers with flip-flop line buffers fed from the SDRAM gave the same symptom, pixel bits stuck at 0 per flip-flop and per seed, which DEV-017 traced to pixel-clock branches fed through dead clock-bridge pips. A gate-level simulation of the 1-bit netlist against Gowin's DPB models drew the picture correctly, and a decode of Gowin and Apicula builds of one test design found matching BSRAM attributes and routing apart from WRITE_MODE (gowin_pack's get_DP_fuses reads WRITE_MODE while Yosys emits WRITE_MODE0 and WRITE_MODE1)."
  consequence: "TinyNES no longer keeps frame buffers in block RAM: they are in the SDRAM, read into flip-flop line buffers, and the palette and emphasis stores are written and read on the pixel clock only; tools/build_ae350_soc.sh fails if any video block RAM has two clocks or a width that is not a multiple of 9. The desk layer's cell store (core-log entry 21) is five 9-bit slices because Yosys mapped it as one 37-bit store to 4Kx4 DPB blocks; in 9-bit DPX9B mode on the pixel clock alone it drew correctly on hardware. The other block RAM modes were not retried after the clock-bridge fix of DEV-017, so whether any of them is faulty in its own right is not known; a design that needs block RAM on two clocks should first be checked on hardware with the pixel or second clock routed as DEV-017 requires."

  consequence: "tools/build_ae350_soc.sh writes ae350_soc.bin beside ae350_soc.fs; tools/deploy_tinytang.sh puts it on the card as /root/cores/console138k/tinynes.bin with TinyTang's tinytang_put.py, with the NES player as /root/ae350/tinynes-play.elf and its launcher as /root/scripts/open/nes.tdsh, and runs tangload, leaving the desk layer as it is; which with the 4.67 MB upload took 17 s in all; tools/load_ae350.py --tinytang opens /dev/ttyACM0 with DTR raised, checks the console is at a prompt with the status probe (TOOL-011), runs fpgapipe and then the same load protocol as one-wire. The link is still 2 Mbaud, so program uploads run at the one-wire rate; a faster upload needs a higher rate at both ends, exts_uart.sv included. After tangload, TinyTang asks the new core for its ID (AA 00 01 01); the boot ROM's loader hunts for its magic and ignores those bytes. The desk layer's mirror sends display frames to whatever core is loaded, hence turning it off before tangload."

  verified_date: 2026-10-13
  statement: "nextpnr-himbaechel takes the speed grade from the part string, C1/I0 for GW5AST-LV138PG484AC1/I0. Gowin's GW5AST-138C.tm carries no C1/I0 table: only its first three chunks decode, the first matching DS1239E Table 3-13's C2/I1 column to about 0.002 ns, the second and third unidentified (the third a uniform 0.862 x the first), and they are shared by every GW5 and GW3A device. The aquasock Apicula fork therefore publishes C1/I0 as 1.25 x C2/I1, the ratio DS1239E gives on every row, under the keys C1/I0, C2/I1, unidentified_1 and unidentified_2; its acceptance test against Gowin's own timing analysis has not been run. The routing-delay groups (wire, glbsrc, hclk, fanout) are the family-generic GW5A ones. The .tm's IO and IOLOGIC blocks are inherited GW2A data that do not describe this die (Gowin's OBUF arc is over 3 times the block's largest value), so the fork publishes none, and the .tm has no PLL model for GW5A; nextpnr emits no arcs for them."
  consequence: "TinyNES's reported Fmax covers fabric-to-fabric paths only, at one grade with no temperature corners. Paths into and out of OSER10s, ODDRs and IO buffers are not timed at all: the 30 TMDS-encoder-to-OSER10 data paths (31 to 42 tiles long in the seed-5 image), the OSER10s' PCLK-to-FCLK phase, the TMDS clock lane, the SDRAM's ODDR clock and every pin. fpga/ae350_soc/ae350_soc.sdc also declares pix_clk5 and pix_clk as unrelated clocks. Such paths must be made correct by construction (registers placed at the OSER10s, vendor clocking) and proven on hardware across temperature (DEV-018), or measured with Gowin EDA's analysis as a reference."

On the A25 at 750 MHz, with code and data in the SDRAM, both caches on and the stack in block RAM, the program was 3,586,108 bytes and loaded in 19.44 s; retro_init and retro_load_game took 780,965 us; retro_run averaged 23,164 us (minimum 14,360, maximum 25,279) against the core's 60.0988 Hz frame period of 16,639 us, so 1,717 frames ran over and the speed was 71.8 percent. All 15 interval lines and the final line of VIDEO and AUDIO CRC-32s matched the PC build of the same harness, which averaged about 361 us a frame and gave identical checksums on two runs."
  consequence: "The A25 emulates the same frames and samples as a PC, so the libretro core, the runtime and the soft-float build are correct for this game; it needs about 1.4 times the speed for 60 frames a second. Untested levers are the cache prefetch bits (DEV-014), -O3 and other compiler options, the FPU (DEV-012), and placing hot code or data in the 64 KiB block RAM; the 32 KiB caches (DEV-013) cannot hold the core's code. The 0.78 s start includes parsing nst_db_xml, the 997,437-byte XML cartridge database that libretro.cpp compiles in from nstdatabase.hpp; it was not timed on its own. Another core, such as FCEUX, would be measured the same way. FCEUmm was (EMU-002), and Nestopia was dropped for it in core-log entry 12; the levers above were then tried on FCEUmm only (EMU-003)."

The user chose it on these figures in core-log entry 12 and Nestopia was dropped (PROV-006).

With EMU-002's Castlevania image and script on the A25, one run each: XRGB8888 at -O2 averaged 19,143 us a frame with BLIT 8,231 us (86.9 percent, 1,715 frames over); with mcache_ctl bits 0x600 set, 19,091 us and BLIT 8,230 (87.1 percent); with 0x2000, 19,203 and 8,231 (86.6 percent); at -O3, 19,404 and 8,252 (85.7 percent), the program 95,256 bytes larger.

  consequence: "BLIT is 43 percent of the XRGB8888 frame on the A25 against 8 percent on the PC: the 245,760-byte frame is written through the 32 KiB write-back D-cache (DEV-013) to the SDRAM, and halving it to 122,880 bytes saves 3.2 ms. Emulation without BLIT is about 10.9 ms a frame. nes_bench now builds RGB565 by default (WANT_32BPP=1 restores XRGB8888), stays at -O2 (OPT= selects others), and the prefetch and write-around bits do not exist (DEV-014). The walk right still runs at the limit, so steady 60 frames a second needs BLIT smaller still; a display path that reads the 8-bit picture and applies the palette in FPGA logic would remove it, which is not built. The harness's environment switch strips RETRO_ENVIRONMENT_EXPERIMENTAL from cmd, so its labels must too: before this change GET_INPUT_BITMASKS was never answered and FCEUmm read the pad bit by bit, with the same checksums."

With the channels on, EMU-002's 1,800-frame script ran on the board at 10,838 us a frame (minimum 3,930, maximum 12,074), 153.5 percent, no frame over, LATE 0, MISSED 0, and its last checksum line matched the PC build; the play build of EMU-005, sending each frame's samples to the I2S2 (AUD-001), ran 5,866 frames by hand at 11,247 us, 147.9 percent, with no underrun and no dropped sample, 119 us a frame to send the sound, and the FIFO level between 800 and 1,343 pairs with one sample repeated and 42 dropped."
  consequence: "nes_bench's firmware/apps/nes_bench/fceu_settings.c, built with the core's flags, sets the five volumes to 256 after FCEUI_Initialize. Mixing real sound costs nothing measurable. The AUDIO checksums before core-log entry 18 covered silence, so they are not comparable with later ones; the default benchmark's final line is now VIDEO=f2160661 AUDIO=4512be2f. In the play run the pairs played per HDMI frame came to 813.71 against 813.77 sent, about 0.1 percent apart and within the counters' one-frame resolution; the one-sample correction absorbs it. One earlier play run, while the samples were still zero, overflowed the FIFO (437 drops with 284 corrections in 1,582 frames) and another the same day did not; the cause is not known."

With page 19 skipped it scores 84 of 146 passed with 10 skipped; with only that test skipped, page 19's other tests leave the PPU so that t Register Quirks and Attributes As Tiles fail their sprite-zero precondition, and it scores 83. The failures that remain cluster on the DMC DMA's cycle (pages 13, 14 and 15 and INC $4014, whose codes say the DMA should update the data bus or is mistimed), PPU dot timing (page 18, $2002 flag timing, sprite zero's exact dot, pages 21 and 22) and the CPU's get and put cycle parity (Controller Strobing code 4, Frame Counter IRQ code 7).

The CS4344 takes I2S: with an external SCLK, data up to 24 bits valid on the rising edge, SDIN setup and hold and SCLK-to-LRCK times of at least 20 ns, SCLK duty 45 to 55 percent; it enters external-SCLK mode on 16 SCLK rises in one LRCK period. At power-up the outputs ramp for about 250 ms after MCLK appears and audio starts about 2,000 sample periods after valid LRCK and SDIN."
  consequence: "fpga/ae350_soc/i2s_out.sv counts MCLK (bus / 6, 12.5 MHz, three bus clocks high), SCLK (MCLK / 4, 64 Fs) and LRCK (MCLK / 256) from the 75 MHz bus clock, so Fs is 48,828.125 Hz, inside the 256x limit, and no clock is added to the clock network (DEV-017). LRCK and SDIN change as SCLK falls, about 160 ns from each rising edge; each channel is a delay bit, the 16-bit sample and zero padding. The clocks run from reset with silence, so the DAC has initialised long before a program plays. 48,828.125 Hz is not a standard rate: FCEUmm is run at 48,909 Hz to make one HDMI frame's samples a frame (EMU-006).

VDD 1.8 to 3.6 V (3.3 typical); inputs high at 0.7 VDD and above, low at 0.3 VDD and below; output high at least 0.9 V and low at most 0.1 V. RF output -20 to +22 dBm, filter insertion loss 1 to 3 dB (2 typical), sensitivity -129 dBm (one figure, its LoRa settings not stated), frequency 820 to 960 MHz at +-10 ppm.

That revision lists FCC and NCC certification as under test. Retail listings tie UPC 612789267033 to model RYLR998."
  consequence: "Its 3.3 V logic and supply match the FPGA's LVCMOS33 pins and a PMOD socket's 3.3 V pin, while the empty SDRAM header J10 carries only +5 V (BRD-008), over its 3.6 V limit. PMOD1 carries the I2S2 and PMOD0 the Wii buses, of which the player reads only buses 1 and 2 (PMOD-007), so bus 3 or bus 4's pair could carry its UART, with 3.3 V from PMOD0 pin 6 or 12; whether that pin supplies 140 mA is not on record (Sipeed rates no PMOD current here). Attached to the FPGA, it works only under a core that bridges it, since the shell runs on the BL616. Nothing in this project drives it yet.

  status: VERIFIED
  verified_date: 2026-10-21
  statement: "hdl-util's HDMI transmitter takes one audio word per clk_audio cycle and its audio logic is clocked by clk_audio: packet_picker samples that clock in the pixel domain and detects its rising edge, and audio_clock_regeneration_packet counts those edges over N/128 samples to measure CTS against the pixel clock, so any real sample rate is declared correctly without a table of its own (N is the 48 kHz value, which only sizes the measurement window). On this board the I2S unit's frame rate is 75 MHz / 1536 = 48,828.125 Hz, so a design that feeds the transmitter that stream must put clk_audio and the words in the pixel domain: the I2S side flips a toggle once per frame and mirrors the shifter's own frame register, and the pixel side latches the pair when the two-stage synchronised toggle changes and raises clk_audio for exactly one pixel clock. Two other shapes were built and carried no audio: a free-running 48,828.125 Hz clock made by dividing bus_clk, and the same handshake with the FIFO's pop-cycle value sampled at the frame boundary, which is zero outside the cycle it is popped."
  consequence: "Treat the transmitter's audio inputs as pixel-domain signals. Gating the pixel clock for one cycle per sample is deliberate and is what the working image does; do not hand the module a clock from another domain and expect its audio logic to run. The sink accepts a non-nominal declared rate: 48,828.125 Hz played on the television this board drives, so the exact-48 kHz option (a 12.288 MHz master clock and another PLL) is not needed for correct pitch. A test tone generated in the pixel domain and fed through the same path is the fastest way to separate a broken packet path from a silent sample source, and it was what located this fault."

Before the wiring, a 1.1 kHz tone generated from the pixel counter and sent through the same packets was audible on HDMI, which proved the data islands, the ACR packets and the synchronisers; with the tone gated on the I2S pair being non-zero it fell silent, which located the fault in the sample handoff rather than the packet path."

## 7. Maintenance boundary

- Keep external facts, their sources, and their verification status here.
- Board faces shared with another project are cited, not copied. The PMOD socket pins, the seating rule and the personality registry live in Tang-Phosphor's `.ai/core-reference.md` beside the constraint file and the RTL that implement them; this file records only the part that bounds this firmware, so the same board does not acquire two sources that can drift.
- The exception is a project being archived. Tang-PSX is backed up and kept, but stops being a live source, so the records that bear on this firmware were copied here as PSX-001 through PSX-006. Copying is for reach, not for preservation: nothing is lost when that project is archived, but its reference stops being the thing anyone consults day to day.
- Keep build results, failures, rationale, and chronology in `core-log.md`; cite a log entry number in `verification` instead of repeating it.
- Do not add speculative records for topics that have not been looked up. An unanswered question stays out of this file until a source answers it.
- Keep this file current rather than historical: when a record's source is replaced by a newer document or tool version, or its fact changes, revise the record in place and let git and `core-log.md` carry the history (section 1).
- A `core-syntax.md` audit is required whenever this file changes, per `.ai/core.md`.

These ids are no longer records. Each one's facts that are still true were carried into the record named, so code, documents and log entries that cite a retired id should be read as citing that record. The summary is what the retired record said, kept so an old citation can be understood; it is not current fact. The full text is in git history.

| PMOD-003 | PMOD-004 | Recorded the socket control register as 0x10, which is the bring-up core's map only |
| PMOD-005 | PMOD-006 | Tang-Phosphor's merged core adds personality 5, I2S2 stereo PCM playback; TinyTang parses /tang.ini (tang_ini.c) and sends it to a core with ID 0x50 at ABI 1.8 or later after every tangload, accepting none, oledrgb, encoder, i2s2, vga_j1 and vga_j2, refusing per the contract and warning about unknown keys; flip is applied as declared, with no flip-safety check yet; on the board only through host tests so far |
| FLS-001 | FLS-002 | Recorded the application slot as at most 0x80000 bytes with staging at 0x100000, a limit Tang-Control chose rather than one the flash or the vendor loader imposes |
| TDSH-001 | TDSH-004 | Recorded TinyDesk Shell v0.1.3 at 232a39f and its scripting language |
| TDSH-003 | TDSH-004 | TinyDesk Shell v0.1.4 at 3b7d7f8, the same language as v0.1.3; its terminal interface adds optional columns() and read_byte_timeout(), and without either the line editor assumes 80 columns |
| TDSH-006 | TDSH-008 | Each tdsh run clones a 19,096 B session (97% the 64-entry variable table) into a 19,352 B job and asks for a 32 KB stack; with the desktop open only ~7.7 KB lies outside the 40.5 KB largest block, so a script's own small allocations are refused and it returns silently (upstream issue #2) |
| TDSH-007 | TDSH-008 | TinyTang's first smaller configuration used 32 variables, 32-byte names, 128-byte values and a 16 KB stack, bringing its session to 5,752 B |
| TDESK-001 | TDESK-013 | Recorded TinyDesk's four-function port surface and its shell pin at 232a39f |
| TDESK-010 | TDESK-011 | Called the Files app's delete dialog a possible TinyDesk bug and suspected it of removing /scripts/boot.tdsh, which the user had deleted themselves |
| TDESK-012 | TDESK-013 | TinyDesk v0.1.4 at f4c1d29 pins the shell at 3b7d7f8, the same as this project; td_hal_t is unchanged, and the Terminal passes its window width to the backend's start() and resize() for the shell bridge to hand to the line editor |
| PROV-002 | PROV-005 | Recorded the licence and notice files when they landed, at which point the project licence was Apache-2.0 |
| PROV-004 | PROV-005 | TinyTang's own code is MIT, in LICENSE; the single exception is ports/bl616/tang_jtag_programmer.c, which stays Apache-2.0 as nand2mario's file with its text at LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt and a note added to its header. Apache-2.0 was never required - it is permissive, and there is no copyleft in the tree |
| BLE-013 | BLE-014 | Starting the Bluetooth stack takes 15,828 B of heap (84,120 free before, 68,292 after, of 127,248) on top of BLE-002's static cost; a connection costs about 700 B, and free heap returns to the same figure after each reconnect |
| TOOL-008 | TOOL-016 | Linked out of the SDK, each under its own licence rather than the SDK's: FreeRTOS V10.4.6 (MIT, (C) 2021 Amazon.com) via CONFIG_FREERTOS, CherryUSB (Apache-2.0) for the CDC console and its FreeRTOS OSAL, and FatFs R0.15 w/patch3 (ChaN, source-redistribution condition only); LVGL, TJpgDec, mbedTLS, littlefs and the codecs are not linked |
| TOOL-009 | TOOL-011 | Recorded the console's input as exclusive and the guard as looking for the desktop's markers, which stopped working once the desktop's drawing left USB (USB-007): tangput feeds the same CDC byte stream the desktop reads its typed input from, so a transfer is safe only while the console is at a shell prompt, and the desktop holding it turns a file into keystrokes; tools/tinytang_put.py's require_shell() guard checks for the desktop's markers ([Start], Terminal - tdsh, or the alternate-screen sequence) before sending |
